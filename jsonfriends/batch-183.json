        "review": "Overwatch 1 was one of my favorite games of all time, despite its awful balancing, repetitive events and eventual developer neglect.\n\nOverwatch 2, on the other hand, is the result of somehow furthering that developer neglect, going 0.5 steps forward and going more than 100 steps back with the most boring gameplay loop, toxic fanbase, egregious monetization, soulless atmosphere and stereotypical free-to-play live service model in the history of this declining industry we call “gaming.”\n\nOverwatch 1 was a game for all skill levels and type of players. Overwatch 2, on the other hand, is a game for nobody.\n\nPros:\n+ The visuals are still vibrant and colorful, I guess\n+ There’s plenty of accessibility options, from crosshair customization to toggling hold/tap for certain abilities\n+ You don't need to install the Battle.net client to play the game on Steam\n+ I mean... Game still runs really well, framerate-wise. You won't get high framerates from low - max settings in other games the way you do in this game.\n+ the Training Mode offered in this game is the same as Overwatch 1's: versatile, vertical, excellent and offers the tools you need to test new heroes\n\nMid:\n+- Character cast is diverse, but with a big caveat; the characters take a lot of time to unlock. To further this, newer heroes are locked every season behind a slow-progressing battle pass that forces you to pay for the new hero otherwise, or be forced to wait a whole season to complete a long set of challenges, creating balancing and pay-to-win controversy. The newer characters also feel super uninspired and designed purely around a game's current state instead of legitimate innovation.\n+- the UI gets the job done but looks basic and soulless compared to the first game\n+- Custom games and its community offer more creativity than the actual developers... but the game doesn't reward you in any way \n\nCons:\n- No game, whether F2P or a paid live-service, has had monetization as bastardized, greedy, overinflated as Overwatch 2. $20 skins and somehow being worse than Valorant’s $100 skin bundles is some of the biggest dog-shittery I’ve seen, even for typical greedy corporate monetization standards. The battle pass is also the lowest-quality, heaviest-grinding, pathetic battle pass in gaming history. Also, forcing people to pay $15 for three PvE missions that take 30 minutes to beat *total* is a no-go, especially when that money can be used towards full games and DLC that last far longer and provide better entertainment value. \n- PvE is false promises after false promises: skill trees, campaign-tied character progression and a free trial for Invasion missions that we were promised were all removed to prioritize the cash-grab that is the live-service aspect of this game, mixed with incompetent direction by the higher-ups and the developers' laziness, blatantly admitted during their PvE update livestream... \n- It took 5 whole in-game seasons (10 months) to bring back \"On Fire:\" a LEGACY FEATURE that used to make players feel good about good play, but now showers you with the same feature over one *assist* and nothing else\n- Ranked/Competitive is grindy, inconsistent, tedious and unrewarding\n- Queue times are still bad like post-2018 Overwatch 1\n- Hacking/cheating is a far bigger issue than it was in Overwatch 1\n- Servers are far more unstable than Overwatch 1: packet burst from bad connections that previously weren't an issue in the first game with bad ping \n- The 5v5 format and passives across all 3 roles caused further balancing issues across both the character cast and the pace of the game; causes further steamrolling/one-sided games, makes supports feel like get-out-of-jail-free mobile rats, tanks just better DPS that feel like brick walls to shoot at, etc.\n- The yearly recycled events make the gameplay loop feel even more boring; now purely a cashgrab with almost no way to earn skins for free\n- For some reason, new accounts now require not just phone verification, but specifically, smartphone/phone-plan verification.\n- Push is an ABOMINATION that goes everything against Overwatch stands for; awkward spawns that take too long to reach objective, camping objective, high ground and flank spam, one-sided matches where losing the first engagement basically loses you the whole match, OBJ-robot is dumb, etc. \n- For some reason, map pools/rotations exist? In a game that used to not remove and cycle maps? When the game is already lacking in content???\n- Endorsements no longer mean anything when all it does is *occasionally* offer 1/5th of a single battle pass tier... out of a whopping 80 tiers. Keyword: Occasionally\n- Arcade offers pointless party modes that get old quick... no longer including the incentive to play for free cosmetics! \n\nHeroes were promised to never be paywalled... look where that led us.\n\nPvE was promised to be grand with replayability and skill trees... Where are they?\n\nSkins that were once obtainable for FREE... now locked behind $10 - 20 paywalls... EACH, with $30 - 60 bundles... What?!?!? Helps less that you can only get 60 Coins a WEEK... out of 1000 - 1900 PER SKIN.\n\nWhat was once a fun game is now one of, if not the most boring, greedy, soulless, repetitive, fundamentally awful and unrewarding experiences of ALL TIME that serves as nothing but the living definition of everything wrong with the gaming industry today, alongside Blizzard's downfall from their glory days.\n\nAll in all, I regret to inform everyone reading this essay of a review that as a massive fan of Overwatch 1, I suffered whilst writing this review as much as I suffered playing this sorry, lazy, lying excuse of a so-called \"sequel.\"",

Sometimes you got that emote you really wanted.\n\nNow? Now we just play for the \"Team\" and our \"Rank\" and pay 20 dollars for skins we could've gotten for free but just having fun. It's all competitive now. Go play TF2 for a casual game where you can fuck around and buy cosmetics for all 9 characters for 5 dollars.\n\nHow far you have fallen.

        "review": "Wow, the audacity of Blizzard to bring this game to steam.\nThey really must be getting desperate for mone- ermh, I mean, players.\n\nFor those that are completely unaware, the short summary of what has happened, excluding all the other Blizzard scandals and flops, is that the original Overwatch was put on life support after they announced that OW2 was coming, with the main focus being PvE for the sequel. Fast forward, they finally released OW2, except there was no promised PvE and it was just Overwatch 1 with cut features, a balance update, a paid battle pass and pretty much removing the ability to earn skins by playing.  They basically took away the product that people had paid for previously and filled it with a cash shop. \nThey did also show a roadmap that hinted that the PvE will be coming after a few seasons. Okay that's not the worst, right? Give players the updated PvP early to build hype for PvE that's coming soon. Well, they didn't hold up to their release date promises and delayed the PvE further with no confirmed released date. The community was left in the dark and let down yet again. \n\nNow in recent months they came forward and said that they're giving up on the original promises of vastly replayable PvE mode with a progression and customization system and will instead release story missions spread out, bit by bit. Missions that most likely are glorified versions of PvE event missions from the original Overwatch, which are no longer available due to the release of OW2. They even dared to say that they're doing all of this to focus on what \"players really want\", which apparently is ongoing support for PvP.\n\nSo they want you to pay money for butchered PvE that will probably take a bit over an hour to finish.  \n\nI don't think I'll go on more about all the other little details that have happened during the lifespan of OW2, but let's just say that the balancing team is still incompetent and the game now has a predatory monetization system.\nThe recent Diablo 4 release was also terrible, clearly all of their talent has left the company long ago. I've also heard that WoW and Hearthstone are having increasing monetization features.\nSo in summary, Activision Blizzard is probably the scummiest gaming company and it doesn't deserve your money or leeway from criticism. Overwatch being a victim of their greed and now just a shadow of it's former self.\nBobby Kotick is probably going to cry into his dollar bills about how he is the victim again and that everyone else is wrong.",

Tão bom e divertido que a Valve tentou de tudo pra competir, até fez um jogo inspirado chamado Team Fortress 2 que não agradou nem um pouco o grande público por conta de suas partidas cheias de desbalanceamento, paywalls, personagens chatos, mal desenvolvidos e sem carisma, fora que até 2016 ele NÃO tinha matchmaking (sério meu, até 2016, na era dos eSports, a Valve se RECUSAVA a se adaptar aos tempos modernos). Porém, como a Valve viu que não ia conseguir derrubar o titã dos FPS, decidiu juntar dinheiro durante anos pra comprar o jogo e pra colocar na Steam. Excelente jogo!",

        "review": "As a longtime Overwatch fan and player on Battle.net since 2016 (a little under 500 hrs of gameplay in OW1), I can't recommend this iteration of the game at all (spent less than 10 hours playing OW2). The old lootbox and credit systems were much less money-hungry and way more rewarding than the new half-baked battlepasses and FOMO-focused shop cosmetics; old players have been pushed aside in lieu of attracting new fans who don't know what used to be and will blindly give Blizzard money for every little update or cosmetic based on their experiences with other f2p shooters. \n\nThe battlepass would be more worthwhile even if you could just fill past seasons, reducing the fear of missing out on cosmetics when you can't or don't want to play. I didn't buy a single battlepass knowing I didn't like the game's changes enough to ever play beyond level 10 or 20, even though I liked some of the cosmetics enough to consider buying.\n\nNot to mention the game was released in a basically broken state, essentially an unfinished beta. Systems like end cards and endorsements, earning credits for won games, level borders and medals, on-fire, competitive rank updates between every match, 2CP mode and entire maps, and long-term PvE missions were all removed on launch and have barely started to return. The new 5v5 format is still struggling to feel balanced (since the original team roles were built around 6v6) and makes playing any role except DPS a chore; if you have one bad tank you've basically lost.\n\n4 years of waiting for Overwatch 2 (more like 0.5) were absolutely not worth it, and the worst part is no longer being able to play the game I once enjoyed playing daily, the game I actually didn't mind paying for. The Invasion update is inviting as the start of something bigger, but unless it proves to be worth replaying (aka worth the money), it's going to fall flat after the initial hype dies down, since people can just watch gameplay of the missions for free online. Until Blizzard returns to rewarding its playerbase well instead of treating them like living wallets, or they add a legacy edition of the game, I can't see myself ever playing regularly. The only reason I have OW2 installed now is to gather art references and admire the art team's hard work, check my playtime stats for this review, and clinging onto hope that the trainwreck can eventually be steered back onto its rail.",

        "review": "[h1] As an OW veteran with over 3k hours poured into this franchise along with achieving top 500 status multiple times in a 7 year span, I cannot fathom how they massacred my boy. [/h1]\n\nRant: Before I start this review, I just wanna say that I wish OW1 was back. It wasn't a perfect or flawless game by any means, but at least it had a decent progression system and didn't have predatory micro-transactions built into it. OW2 doesn't need to exist, they just needed a competent balancing team in OW1 that actually knew wtf they were doing and updated the game with more content. Apparently that wasn't the case and was just too much to ask. Just like the PVE mode was too much to do. Poor little Indie company with a small loan of $70 billion dollars can't dish out what they promised.\n\nReview:\n\n\"I loved the part when Reinhardt said, HAMMER DOWN!! and shattered all of the PVE concepts into oblivion. What a powerful and truly inspirational moment.\"\n\nNothing pisses me off more than wasted potential and that is Blizzard's middle name. This really could've been something great, but this is just another franchise that was completely [b] destroyed [/b], [b] brutalized [/b], [b] dismantled [/b], [b] eradicated [/b], and [b] gutted [/b] by corporate greed, false promises and anti-consumerism. The whole selling point of OW2 was the, you guessed it, PVE. DO NOT be blinded by this so called \"PVE\" they just regurgitated out to try and earn back their consumer's respect (and money, mostly the money). They have promised key features for PVE such as 150+ story missions, skill-trees, and a fully fledged out campaign story mode that improves on all the lore of the characters for 4 YEARS only to come out and tell us on 5/16/2023 that PVE was canceled; shocking the entire fandom and decimating morale for both the developers and fans. Although there is a hollow shell of 'PVE' here for, ahem $15, this is not even a fraction of what Blizzard had promised to us fans, or should I say FORMER fans. \n\n\"I loved the part when Zenyatta said, walk along the path to live service. What a glorious moment to remind us all of the current state of gaming.\" \n\nThis ain't the only time they have lied to their consumers about OW related topics. Activision Blizzard are some scumbag liars by saying Overwatch 1 would be cross-compatible with Overwatch 2., news flash, it's not, they just removed the product the consumer paid for and gave you this downgraded version of the original game instead. Not to mention lying AGAIN during the transition from OW1 to OW2, saying that you wouldn't be needing your Overwatch 1 coins for Overwatch 2 and to spend them while you still can. NEWSFLASH, you can get items easily with the Overwatch 1 coins, it's almost as if they made us all waste our coins from Overwatch 1 to use their NEW CURRENCY that you have to pay REAL MONEY for! Overwatch does NOT need to have live service BS implemented into it and definitely does NOT need to be pay to win. \n\n\"I loved the part when Kiriko said, Let the Micro-transactions guide you! A tear inducing moment and truly a peak Overwatch experience.\"\n\nThe micro-transactions in this game are a huge problem since Blizzard does not care about your time or your money. In OW1, there was no shop where you had to spend money on cosmetics. In OW1, there were lootboxes and those lootboxes contained items ranging from common, rare, epic, and legendary quality. I know lootboxes are ludicrous as well, but they were much better than whatever the hell this crap is with an in-game shop where you have to spend 1900 in-game coins which is $20 dollars on a single skin. If you so choose to grind out this particular skin, you will have to complete weekly challenges that only offer around 60 coins a week (That's IF you manage to complete all the challenges that week). To get that skin that costs 1900 coins, you will be playing nearly 32 weeks or 8 months worth of Overwatch to get that ONE SKIN. The bundles in this game range from $25 to nearly $50 goddamn dollars. With the lootboxes in OW1, you were almost guaranteed to get some good loot just by playing the game and earning them lootboxes along the way. \n\nOverwatch is the kind of game where you switch heroes to counter the enemy team which is exactly WHY heroes, especially OP ones, should NOT be LOCKED behind a PAY-WALL for this particular game! If you haven't bought the battle pass to get a certain character that is powerful/broken, guess what, YOU LOSE! FUN!!! BATTLE PASS DIFFERENTIAL!!! \n\nThis really used to be something special back in 2016-2017 and they just pissed all over its iconic glory. IT WON GAME OF THE FREAKING YEAR FOR CRYING OUT LOUD and ended up being in THIS state. This just goes to show that companies can VERY EASILY kill off a franchise by being greedy corporate scumbags. No wonder Jeff from the Overwatch Team left. Rip Overwatch 2016-2023, ruined and desecrated by Activision Blizzard. \n\nOverall Rating: OW 0.9/10. The fanart is at least good.\n\n[b] Disclaimer: TF2 has a cute seal :). [/b]",

        "review": "A little story before i get to my personal thoughts of this Overwatch \"sequel.\"\n\nThis game was one of the many childhood games i've always wanted the chance to play. I remember getting it on my PS4 (but not even playing it on there) and waited for the opporitunity to get Overwatch on my PC. Then around December 2020/January 2021 Blizzard published a free trial of Overwatch 1, and I had to get it. Unfortunatley like with the PS4, I didn't play it so much. Then a year later, two days before Overwatch 2 released with Season 1, I bought Overwatch 1 on PC. When the trial of Overwtch 1 happened and when I bought the game on PC, all I would do for some reason is go to the practice range and mess around for a bit, and not even play the actual game for some reason. It's kinda funny. But with Overwatch 2's release, I got to play Overwatch a bit more and understand the game a lot better now that I have access to it.\n\nNow on my personal thoughts on how Overwatch 2 became, It's not great. even though I have little experience with Overwatch 1, I kinda prefer to either go back to Overwatch 1 entirely or at least find a way to bring back 6v6 PvP. But it's not just that.\n\nThe game now has a battle pass instead of loot boxes,  and loot boxes were really player-friendly at the time. You would always wonder what you're gonna get after playing the game, and even sometimes get loot boxes from special events. Nowadays with this clunky-ass battle pass and shop systems, all Blizzard wants is your credit card to get all of the cosmetics you want, and it's just stupid. Sure, it makes them money, but I would rather focus more on players than money.\n\nThe gameplay is fine. It's just the same Overwatch with some new systems and game modes (minus Assault/2CP) and it's fine. The replay-ability is kinda debatable though, and even the competitive scene is also just whack compared to Overwatch 1. So wack to the point where people think ranking up is entirely RNG-based, and most of the time (i guess) it's bad, at least for me. But i don't wanna talk about that.\n\nAlso, the beloved PvE with skill trees and extra things that I forgot because this game was announced like 4 years ago now (as of the time of this review) and with what we all have now, most of what we were promised was cut, and the story missions are paid instead of free. The paid story missions I can kinda get because Blizzard really wants to be Microsoft so bad with their Halo Infinite campaign but whatever.\n\nPlay this game if you want, but just know that if you are gonna get addicted to this \"sequel\" of a game, you might need some sort of wallet with you.",

        "review": "В Overwatch 1 и 2 у меня наиграна в общем 1000+ часов за 7 лет игры. \nДумаю каждый человек, который играл в первую часть или в другие игры данной кампании, знает что \nBlizzard самые жадные, глупые вруны и наsiльники. Я бы с вами хотел пройтись по значимым успехам этой игры (Которые у меня всплывают думая о данной \"Серии\" игр)\n\n* В 2016 выходит игра, ловит награды, радует игроков ивентами и бесплатными скинами. После релиза вышло 2 новых персонажа.\n* В 2017 Blizzard решили не делать новые ивенты.  Вышло 3 новых персонажа.\n* В 2018 с сундуков перестают падать так много дубликатов. А новый контент мы получаем только с ивента Архивов. Вышло 3 новых персонажа.\n* В 2019 появились на свет Батист и Сигма, а в 2020 Эхо.\n* С 2019 по 2023 близы прекратили что-то делать и сделали упор на 2 часть игры и её ПВЕ с прокачкой персонажей, умениями, что-то типа рейдов.\n\n\n̤А̤ ̤Т̤Е̤П̤Е̤Р̤Ь̤ ̤М̤О̤Ё̤ ̤Н̤А̤Г̤О̤Р̤Е̤ВШЕЕ + Интересные факты!!!\n\n*Маккри... ой извините это старый сценарий. Я хотел сказать КоЛ Кэссиди бедный персонаж, который был переименован из-за того что в офисе BlizzardКоМпАрЕйШеН был человек с таким именем и он творил плохие вещи. Надеюсь все в мире с именем Маккри теперь меняют паспорта, а то не дело.\n* В 2022 году у всех обладателей Overwatch была изъята игра, а взамен дали костюм ШУТА для Сомбры. Ну вы поняли у всех забрали честно купленную игру и дали бесполезный скин.\n* На старте БЕСПЛАТНОЙ игры Overwatch 2 оценки пользователей составили 1.1 из 10 XD\n* Чтобы купить все скины из первой части, нужно потратить всего $$$12 тысяч$$$\n* В 2022 году близы получили награду \"золотая малина\" за самый худший БатлПасс в играх. И это реально самая лучшая награда, которую может получить эта игра.\n* Турбосвин играю на нём все 7 лет и я думаю многие уже меня поймут. В 2017 году персонаж получил 5 патрон, скорость стрельбы, но потерял много урона из-за чего перестал убивать многих с 1 выстрела. И ЧЕРЕЗ 5 ЛЕТ, когда в игре остался 1 танк, нытики наныли нерф Хога и теперь он самый слабый герой, но с 6 патронами (Да Blizzard всегда взамен дают 1 патрон и забирают урон) И теперь я жду реворка, который обещали через 1 ГОД! Ну разве не угарно.\n* А теперь поговорю о других танках...\n^ Таран удивительный герой с самой большой мобильностью, отсутствием хедшотов, 150 брони у него регенется само, одним его скилом можно нанести 400 урона с кд в 5 секунд. А ещё его каждый патч апают ведь он такой Няшный ( Это слова игроков на Таране )\n^ ДумФист... ещё один персонаж с самой большой мобильностью, возможностью застанить 2 персонажей и убить 1-2 за время стана. Надеюсь что этого индивида который делал реворк не уволили и он сейчас работает над реворком ТурбоСвина.\n^ Королева ну это просто худой ТурбоСвин, у которого больше урона, вампиризм, меньше моделька и скилы сильнее...\n* У Винстона и ТурбоСвина только два скила, когда у всех других танков по 3.\n* В игре появились мифические сеты, которые можно кастомизировать. Так вот сет на Генгу оболтус делал 4 года. Да 4 года он сам так заявил, ну, то есть ему платили ЗП все 4 года, а он вам вместо ПВЕ сет на Генгу делал.\n* А да Кстати обещанное ПВЕ отменили, а именно прокачку, таланты, рейды и что-то там ещё что Blizzard нам обещала.

My son got this game online a month ago, so we installed it on his computer and he started playing. By the end of the week he had 24 hours on this game. This was horrible for me, as it was already hard for me to find ways to spend time with my son, as he is always out with his friends or just watching YouTube. So i decided to make a Steam account and get this game to see if I could maybe play alongside him. I loaded into the game, picked my character and started playing but I was stuck on what you where supposed to do. I asked my Son for help and he hosted a game for me to join. I loved it as it was the best time I had spent with my Son since my wife had died. This game has ever since brought me and my son closer again and now we actually spend time together outside the house together as well. This game reminded me that there's fun to be had in everything, and it has brought both me and my Son many happy memories.",

        "review": "Rating: ★★★★☆ (4/5)\n\nAs a fervent fan of the original Overwatch, I approached the announcement of Overwatch® 2 with a mix of excitement and apprehension. Would it be able to capture the magic of its predecessor while bringing enough new elements to the table? After getting my hands on the game, I can confidently say that Overwatch® 2 not only lives up to the hype but also surpasses it in several ways.\n\nVisual Brilliance: From the moment you enter the game, it's evident that Blizzard has poured their heart and soul into refining the visual experience. The character models are more detailed, environments are richer, and the overall level of polish is remarkable. The seamless blend of familiar characters with fresh designs perfectly bridges the gap between nostalgia and innovation.\n\nExpansive Hero Roster: While some beloved characters return with updated abilities and fresh looks, Overwatch® 2 introduces new heroes that immediately feel like they've been part of the universe since day one. These additions inject new strategies into the game, ensuring that every match remains dynamic and unpredictable. Whether you're a veteran Genji player or eager to master a brand new hero, there's something for everyone.\n\nStory-Driven Gameplay: The inclusion of a robust story mode is a significant step forward. Engaging narrative missions not only delve into the lore of the Overwatch universe but also serve as an excellent way to familiarize yourself with heroes you might not have spent much time with in the original game. The cooperative nature of these missions encourages team coordination and fosters a sense of camaraderie.\n\nPvP Perfection: If you're a fan of competitive gameplay, Overwatch® 2 continues to shine here. The refined balance, new maps, and mode updates breathe fresh life into the PvP experience. It's evident that Blizzard has listened to the community, and the result is a more refined and exhilarating gameplay loop.\n\nCustomization and Progression: The addition of a comprehensive player progression system adds another layer of engagement. Unlocking new cosmetics, leveling up heroes, and customizing abilities provide a sense of achievement beyond the match victories themselves.\n\nBlizzard's Commitment: It's clear that Blizzard is committed to the long-term success of Overwatch® 2. The promise of free hero and map updates post-launch shows their dedication to keeping the community engaged and the game's meta ever-evolving.\n\nIn conclusion, Overwatch® 2 is a triumph. It respects the essence of the original while pushing the boundaries of what the Overwatch universe can offer. Whether you're a die-hard fan of the franchise or a newcomer looking for a rich, team-based shooter, Overwatch® 2 is an absolute must-play. Get ready to join the battle once again and experience a new era of heroism.",

(Una skin costa minimo 1900 crediti quindi fatevi un rapido calcolo per quanto tempo vi serva per comprarne UNA)\n\nIn pratica adesso una persona comune dovrebbe giocare ad OW2 per non ricevenere nessun tipo di premio, nessun livello, nessuna ricompensa, nessuna progressione...niente di niente e ci sono persone che gli regalano anche soldi...\n\nPer non parlare della \"modalità pve\", semplicemente sono gli eventi pve che rilasciavano ma con nuovi nemici venduti come chissà cosa a 15 euro per 3 missioni...veramente ridicoli...",
