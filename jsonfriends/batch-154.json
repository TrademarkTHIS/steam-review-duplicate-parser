        "review": "[h1] Is this game good. Absolutely Yes. Is the game being ruined by Blizzards mistakes? Yes. Have Blizzard lied to the players and made a mess out of PvE. Oh yeah 100% [/h1]\n\nThere are a lot of massive issues with Blizzard recently regarding both monetisation and their absolutely disgraceful handling of the PvE. There is no getting around these issues and 90% of reviews focus on these problems.\n\nOverwatch 2 is one of the best games of all time in my opinion with countless hours of content, many updates planned and massive Blizzard polish. The game has some of the best character diversity in gaming (Thanks to King's Diversity Space Tool which made it's run in the news - +1 points for the character being female and all). The gameplay is smooth with some balancing issues here and there, which sometimes get addressed and sometimes don't. The map variety, gamemodes, workshop content, skins and character abilities are all outstanding, diverse and beautifully made and I am surprised at how well Blizzard have made a hero shooter to this standard back in 2016 when the genre was next to non-existent. The clutter and confusion in the game is one of the hardest points for a new player to get past but you get used to that.\n\nIt would be foolish of me to not mention that Overwatch 2, being the sequel to Overwatch 1 was promised as being a expansive PvE experience, which they themselves described as being as repayable as Destiny 2. It is barely anything close to that and instead a disastrous failure of a sequel. However, unlike what the playerbase had to deal with while they discovered that they are too incompetent to make a PvE, the game is being updated, there is a lot of work being done and the PvP, which is the true meat of this game, is outstanding. The game is live service and depending on how it proceeds may continue to get better, or the whales will take over and everything will cost money in the game.\n\nThe art, sound, animation, story and design team always will bring this game to a 10/10. The gameplay and programming teams seem to let them down, and countless times miss their mark. Hopefully the brigading of OW2 on Steam starts to slow down so that people can actually see that the game is actually a really damn good game and that it is only a few obvious issues bringing the game down to the reviewing masses. It does not deserve a sub 30% positive reviews. But then again, I am a Blizzard shill so who the hell cares. TF2 is better or whatever people seem to be trying to say.\n\nThe game is free, pick it up and decide for yourself if the love that the Blizzard team put into the game ages ago can at all be enjoyed. Don't let reviews complaining about issues that you wouldn't even know about bring your opinion down.",

        "review": "It's Overwatch. it's fun but Activision/Blizzard's CEO's obsession with Overwatch League forced devs into pushing out an unfinished game just so that OL could start again with OW2, putting the focus on PvP life service stuff instead of the promised PvE campaign with tons of replayability and talent trees and whatnot. Pretty sad. No wonder most of the original OW team has left. Matchmaking is a joke, competitive is terrible in OW2, Battle Passes are filled with junk no one uses, the game is lacking multiple features that we had before, monetization is super expensive (20$ for skins that were previously obtainable for free via lootboxes you got while levelling up), PvE that is being released is super lackluster compared to what was promised + you HAVE to pay for EACH mission pack instead of just buying access to the campaign once.\n\nIt feels like Blizzard's management really messed up OW2's development and I don't blame the devs for it. The game is in a pretty bad state, yet I'm somewhat optimistic; seasons seem to slowly add in features that makes the game a little more enjoyable even though most of those were old features that we missed in the launch of OW2. The devs seem to be trying their best to make do with what they have and I thank them for it, and Activ/Blizz might be getting bought out by Microsoft and I hope kicking out Kotick is their first action when the merger comes through.\n\nGame's alright, I'll play it, but I really hope things get better because OW2's launch has been atrocious, and they're losing a lot of their playerbase because of it, but the game has so much potential, I really hope it gets to live on and become something genuinely good again.",

El juego en si te puede dar varias horas de diversion, en especial con amigos, pero no te recomiendo para nada que confies en que blizzard le va a dar un buen trato al juego.

It terrifies me how quickly a beloved game turned into a terribly monetized shell of a game, all because of griddy higher-ups. \n\nBack in the good ol' days, we had loot boxes, we could buy skins for a currency that was fully earnable in-game and you'll never guess what else: the game was fun and enjoyable. I suppose that those who played Overwatch back then can relate.\n\nI want to believe that something will change in the future. With every season, I get my hopes up that maybe, just maybe, we will see a light at the end of the tunnel. After that loud PvE cancellation back in May, most of my patience with this game jumped out the window. I still do have some patience left, although it is slowly but surely running out.\n\nSome finishing words: Blizzard never fails to disappoint <3",

        "review": "Let me preface this review by saying that Overwatch was one of the most fun, exciting, and enjoyable games I've ever played. I believe there is no other game out right now that rivaled how good it felt to find a character you enjoy and be able to play them for hours on end in short casual matches as well as competitive environments. The diversity of it's characters in every aspect is near unparalleled in the industry which makes writing this negative review is so frustrating.\nDespite the games strengths, Activision Blizzard is the most out of touch, money hungry, soulless corporation I've ever seen and it breaks my heart that their influence has poisoned this game beyond repair multiple times over. \nWhile it may display on my review that i only have ~0.5 hours, I've played for around 210 hours before Overwatch came to steam and my hours are split pretty evenly between hours played in Overwatch 1 and Overwatch 2. I first played Overwatch 1 in its twilight months and fell in love with it. I was happy to play for hours at a time as my favorite characters with or without friends in the lobby with me and although i was playing during the time of little to no updates and stagnating metas, the unadulterated fun I had was testament enough that at its core Overwatch was a good game and with the heavy marketing for Overwatch 2 on the horizon I was ecstatic to try out the new highly replayable PvE campaign with broad skill trees, diverse enemy types, new maps, expanding lore, and all the bells and whistles to catch the eye of a new excited player such as myself especially since the Archives missions were my favorite part of the Overwatch experience. \nOnce Overwatch 2 was released back in October of last year I hopped back in and found that the magic was still there, but many small things were wrong and/or missing. Where was the \"On Fire\" system? Your character still said the voiceline to indicate it but with no corresponding visual. What happened to the Medals system? What happened to post game lobbies to honor your allies and even enemies? Why was Bastion, Mei, and Torbjorn all disabled for about the first month of the games release? Where was my account level and border? Where is the weapon inspect animation? and last but certainly not least, Where was the PvE campaign? I found many of these things confusing, but not enough to make the game unplayable, and based on developer messages many of these things were simply coming at a later date, namely the On Fire, Weapon Inspect, and PvE campaign, but you can bet that the shop page was 110% fully operational with skins and battlepasses all ready for your purchase on day one.\nBut on May 16th 2023, we recieved news that the PvE campaign was being tremendously downsized and cut of most if not all features to make it interesting or worthwhile. With this announcement it sent a message that Blizzard doesn't care. Most of the people who even pitched Overwatch 2 to focus on PvE aren't even at the company anymore, and it was the remaining and new employees to have this vision they didnt concieve or possible not even agree with, all of a sudden thrust upon them and try to deliver. The PvE was reportedly taking too much time and resources away from the live service. It was stated that \"the effort required to pull all of that together into a Blizzard quality experience that we can ship to you is huge\" and me being relatively new to Overwatch and more importantly Blizzard is that I don't know what \"Blizzard quality\" means. With a surface level understanding of the internets consensus on Blizzards other games the last couple years \"Blizzard quality\" was probably the farthest thing from a compliment i could think of. Additionally the skeleton of the PvE mode was going to cost $15. Once this news broke I completed the current seasons battle pass that I had spent money on as fast as possible, uninstalled the game and have been watching from afar ever since.\nOthers have gone into far more detail about the history of both Overwatch and Blizzards failings and they put it into ways and discuss additional elements not discussed here as well as going beyond what i'm capable of expressing and I highly recommend you to watch any YouTube video discussing this topic.\nOverall, Overwatch has a special place in my memory and the core of a good game is still there, but it seems like the priorities of Overwatch 2 and Blizzard do nothing but disappoint and mislead their customers.",

Are you looking for a similar game that's just as fun? Well this hot steamy pile of feces will never give you the satisfaction TF2 does. The playerbase is either children, ugly egirls, or fat beta cucks.\n\nThis is also the same company full of a bunch of people who sexually abuse women. And if that wasn't enough for you the game itself is a complete mess. Zero balance attempted aside from nerfing characters that don't need to be nerfed just because the aforementioned psychopaths want something to complain about.\n\nAlso you may notice the big fat 2 slapped on the title. Well that's a misleading bait because all the content they promised for a sequel was never given AND they officially cancelled all that content as well that they'd been working on for 4 years just to throw out some poorly done \"PvE\" content they forced the unpaid interns to make cause they're too busy nerfing characters making the game a much slower and boring experience. \n\nThis is why TF2 is the greatest \"Hero\" shooter on the market. Overwatch doesn't even compare. Not even close. \n\n[spoiler]This game is a joke.[/spoiler]",

        "review": "Oyuna aşık oldum, çok önce ilk çıktığı yıllarda ilk oyunu oynamıştım ama Steam takıntısı olan biri olarak bir daha girmedim. Şimdi oyunu hiç bilmeden bir kaç el girdim ama böyle bir oyun gerçekten yok. Kitlesi mük-em-mel. Oyunu bilmeyen biri olarak kimse laf etmiyor birbirine, şarkı açan troller yok, hile hiç görmedim zaten olsa da bu oyunda ne hilesi olabilir bilmiyorum, küfretmeden duramayan değişik türk tayfa yok, rus yok. Oyun da gerçekten eğlenceli, vuruş hissiyatı ve hızlı aksiyon dolu oynanışı gerçekten çok hoşuma gitti. Kolay bir oyun da değil, 30 tane veya daha fazla karakter var ve hepsinin farklı stil oynanışları var. Bazıları kolay bazıları zor ama genel anlamda öğrenmesi kolay ustalaşması zor bir oyun diyebilirim. Herhangi bir P2W özelliği var mı bilmiyorum ama diğer oyunlardan bildiğimiz Battle Pass falan var, biraz göz gezdirdim sadece kozmetik, emote vs. gibi geldi bana, bazı açık olmayan karakterler de gördüm belki onları da oyun içi para ya da gerçek para ile açabiliyoruzdur. Oyun Türkçe değil, gerekte olmadığını düşünüyorum zaten A1-A2 seviyesi çok rahat yeter ki bunlara bile sahip değilseniz ana menüde Google Translate yardımı ile metinleri çevirebilirsiniz, oyunun içerisinde zaten çevirmeniz gereken hiç bir şey yok. Karakterler Riot oyunu misali saçma sapan konuşuyor bir de anons yapan ablamız var. Hikayeli bir mod gördüm, sinematik falan izletti belki onun için biraz ingilizceye sahip olmanız gerekebilir ama o bile bence A2-B1 seviyesinin çok rahat anlayabileceği düzeydeydi. İçeriğini tabi ki oynamadığım için bilmiyorum.\n\nBlizzard ne olur diğer şaheserlerini de Steam'e getir, sonunda kral Steam'e geldiği için aşırı mutluyum. Şu anda tek eksiğimiz Riot Online oyunları, Singleplayer olanlar yine geliyor diye biliyorum, gerçi gelse de çok oynayacağımı sanmam ama gelirse tabi ki hoş olur çeşit olur.\n\nNOT: Bir de bende neredeyse her karakter ve çoğu skin açıktı internetten okuduğuma göre ilk oyunu parayla aldığım için gelmiş. Yani eğer ücretsiz oyuncu iseniz muhtemelen oyun oynadıkça karakterleri para kasarak falan açmanız gerekiyor. Aynı Rainbow Six Siege sistemi gibi yapmışlar sanırım. Düzeltiyorum şimdi farkettim, ya gerçek para vererek ya da görevler var onları tamamlayarak açıyorsunuz yani Rainbow'dan bile zor bir sistem yapmışlar. İyi bir şey mi kötü bir şey mi size kalmış.",
