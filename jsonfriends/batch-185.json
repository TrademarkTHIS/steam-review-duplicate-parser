        "review": "It's literally OW1 with slightly better Lighting on maps other than that it's still shit and you cannot take it seriously if you plan on play it competetively. Level design is terrible and doesn't fit this type of gameplay not to mention the graphical clarity where you can't see anything on your screen because of amount VFXs on your screen emitted from the characters. Speaking of characters - you'd expect that they would be reworked somehow since it's the Second installement of the game but they didn't. All of them are still pretty much \"press button to win a firefight\" against your enemy not to mention the pathetic Rock-Papers-Scissors design.\n\nThis game is sad. In 2016 when it released they kept it simple: Casual Quick-Match and Comp. Nothing else. Now you enter this game and there's just SHIT TON AMOUNT of stupid content that doesn't make sense.\nAlso: Game has a battlepass which is understandable for a Free to Play title but they don't even try to make it good in any way where they respect their playerbase by giving you ability to switch between Battlepassess each season. You missed Season 1 and want to get items from that Battlepass? Go fuck yourself. \n\nBlizzard and Activision needs to be destroyed by any means necessary.",

        "review": "I played this game since season 1. I spent 6 or 7 years of my life on it. it's almost 1/3 if my life that i gave to overwatch. I played for thousands of hours on every gamemods. I remember things that people didn't even know overwatch once had like bastion turret shield, symetra shield generator or widow's butt easter egg. I was there when the overwatch community was at war against the paladin comunity. I was there during the first world cup. I was there during sombra's ARG. But now i'm elswhere. Blizzard treated us like shit, they thought we were money bag and we naively thought they stilled cared about us at the release of overwatch 2. We waited for month, brushing off the disappearance of the free to get loot boxes, brushing off the 20$ skins, trusting them about the lack of archive events due to them working on the PVE. But all that for nothing. All we got in the end is disappointment. we waited for half a month for them to tell us that we wouldn't get what we were promised, they knew it at the release of overwatch 2 but prefered to wait before telling it. Out of all the promises made for the PVE during the reveal, all of them got scraped. It's now just an empty shell of what it was supposed to be. And let's not forget about the PVP side, now, since a big chunk of the community has leaved the way they found to keep most of their player base is smart ! since most of the players are between bronze and gold, they decided to listen to them for the game balance ! That's why now every skill based mechanic like headshot with a sniper or playing complex character are being hard nerf and non skill based mechanic and capacity are being buffed. You hated mccre flash and magnetic nade ? let's merge them together. Everyone hated mei freezing ability ? let's give her something close to that with the excuse to help against high mobility character, whose high mobility is due to their capacities and, surprise, her big slow does not affect capacities but it's now easier to kill slow target and tanks. Why that ? because most bronze to gold know next to nothing about game sens. they don't know how to position themselves, they don't know who to foccus, they don't know who to pick agains who or which composition. But one thing they know is which character is op and don't require a lot of skill, and funny enought but playing an op/annoying character that does not require to learn a lot is funny. In short, if you want a good FPS game with a studio that respect you behind it, run. Run imediately because it's not. the competitive aspect and the respect to the player base has been put aside for proffit. F you blizzard, and you the dev team i hope you will find a better studio that will let you use your creative genius at it's fullest potential without stupides rules like \"crawl, walk, run\".\n\nTLDR : angry first season player says Blizzard does not respect it's community and it's a sorry excuse of a competitive FPS.",

To listen to a commentary node, put your crosshair over the floating commentary symbol and press your primary fire. To stop a commentary node, put your crosshair over the rotating node and press your primary fire again. Some commentary nodes may take control of the game in order to show something to you. In these cases, simply press your primary fire again to stop the commentary. In addition, your secondary fire will cycle you through all the commentary nodes in the level.

[/h1]\nOther than that, Blizzard pretty much just replaced the original game from 2016 with a version that has questionable prices and other gameplay issues.\n \n[list]\n[*]Bring back the end-game cards system. It was such a great system to celebrate post-match achievements and a good place to chat/banter after the game.\n\n[*]The ranked system sucks, just go back the original OW1 SR system. You win a game, SR goes up, you lose a game, SR goes down. Simple.\n\n[*] [h1] Stop locking new Heroes in the battle pass, you're putting the core content of the game behind a paywall / obnoxious grind, and then wonder why player investment is declining??? [/h1]\n\n[*]Bring back the original endorsement system, let us pick between \"shotcaller\", \"good teammate\" & \"sportsmanship\".\n\n[*]Just put 2CP back in the game, it was only a real problem in ranked mode, you didn’t had to straight up remove 2CP from casual mode. Team Fortress 2 has had Dustbowl for YEARS now, and they never took that content out of casual mode.\n\n[*]I don’t miss the lootbox system, but most skins nowadays are rather expensive.\n\n[*]Most of the new events are pretty good, so I’m enjoying myself there.\n\nOverall, the game is still really good, it’s free and very much worth your time. But the original Overwatch 1 feel that we all loved so dearly is lost, lost to the many changes that were done to justify the game becoming a sequel. \n\nAnd that breaks my fucking heart so much.",

Если оценивать саму игру без её контекста, про который можно почитать в соседних обзорах, то это определенно одна из лучших активных командных игр, к сожалению сейчас в мире нету таких же БЫСТРЫХ и сложных как овервотч. ТФ 2 и паладины имеют более медленный мувмент как-никак. Игра неплохо улучшается от сезона к сезону, к балансу есть вопросы, но это субъективщина и всегда спорно, также в игре хуевый донат по шмоткам, который НАДО менять как-то.\nКомпания близард заслужила шмот говно в лицо, но конкретно отдел овервотча, который щас пытается вытащить как то игру из того что от нее когда то осталось - абсолютно не заслуживает, не думаю что решения по монетизации конкретно от работяг исходят. То что ПВЕ отменилось - ну нету и нету уже похуй, как будто кто-то за него заплатил. Ну кроме старых игроков в овервотч 1, которые на 3-4 года стали получать такое же кол-во обнов как ТФ2, то есть нулевое кол-во. Так что конкретно ИГРА - не заслуживает ревью бомбинга и хотя бы попробовать я советую.",

        "review": "Title: Overwatch 2: Disappointing Sequel\n\nIntroduction\n\nOverwatch 2, the highly anticipated sequel to the original hit game, has failed to live up to expectations. With scrapped PvE content, a shortage of new maps and heroes, questionable gameplay changes, and a deficient update schedule, Overwatch 2 lacks the innovation and excitement that players were hoping for.\n\n1. Scrapped PvE Content\n\nThe promised expansive PvE experience in Overwatch 2 was a major draw for players. However, Blizzard's decision to remove significant portions of this content before release left players feeling let down. The absence of the promised PvE missions diminishes the game's potential for engaging cooperative gameplay.\n\n2. Lack of New Maps and Heroes\n\nOverwatch 2 was expected to introduce a fresh array of maps and heroes to diversify gameplay. Unfortunately, the game fell short in this regard. The scarcity of new maps limits the game's replay value, while the limited addition of new heroes restricts the potential for innovative strategies.\n\n3. Questionable Gameplay Changes\n\nThe transition from 6v6 to 5v5 gameplay was a notable shift that altered the game's dynamics. While intended to enhance strategy, it actually removed the chaos and action that players loved in the original game. This change disrupted established tactics and introduced a sense of unfamiliarity.\n\n4. Insufficient Innovation\n\nOverwatch 2 struggles to differentiate itself from its predecessor. The lack of meaningful gameplay mechanics and innovation makes it feel like a mere extension of the first game. The game's failure to offer a substantial upgrade leaves players feeling like they are playing a dated version.\n\n5. Flawed Battle Pass and Update System\n\nThe implementation of a battle pass system was met with criticism, as it seemed to prioritize monetization over player experience. Additionally, the infrequent updates and lack of meaningful patches left players disconnected from the evolving nature of the game. This deficiency diminished the game's longevity.\n\nConclusion\n\nIn summary, Overwatch 2 disappoints due to its scrapped PvE content, dearth of new maps and heroes, questionable gameplay changes, lack of innovation, flawed battle pass system, and infrequent updates. The sequel's inability to deliver on its promises and surpass the original's standards has left fans dissatisfied and longing for a more impactful and engaging experience.",

A character can be so game changing at times can make the game seem pay to win. I get that you can unlock these heroes by doing challenges, but that was something i had to go out looking for. I did not know this until LIfeweaver because Blizzard is more focused on promoting to buy the battle pass.\n    [*] The lack of PvE shows, and will be more detailed in the next list because they're execution in this new update shows how much it will really be missed. \n    [*] Toxic community and devs. Developers do not bother trying in new updates that brings people over. Even if they did, the people who play this game make sure you dont want to be here. Granted this is a problem with this game specifically, rather another one to list in a pile of other communities, but the fact that this game is being carried by R34 artists says a lot about how much people actually care about this game.\n    [*] To be added \n[/list]\n\nNow my problems with this update specifically that came out on this platform:\n[list]\n    [*] Hero progression means nothing. Why have levels for a character and a progression system when there is nothing to progress to? On top of that, why add a whole new progression system when Overwatch 1 has a level progression system for the whole account? ([b] WHICH CAN BE FOUND IN OVERWATCH 2 ALREADY TRACKED [/b]) Update 1: I just found out the hero progression is for title cards. Thats it. I would of taken basic voice lines or sprays rather than a name card. Sad.\n    [*] The new game mode sucks. Maps are too big for team coordination and expands the problem further. Example: you die in a fight and they capture the point. Now there is a whole new spawn location for you and your team, except half of your team is still at the old point, which is over 100m away making fights a 3v5 or less.\n    [*] Beating a dead horse, the lack of PvE is a major loss for this game, and what they added instead of that is a joke. Granted, the paid missions I have not played yet, but if they are similar to what the free one is that I just played, its just Kings Uprising all over again. Bland AI's move from point a to b with lifeless movement makes me feel like im in the shooting range in practice mode. And the objectives are the same thing that has been around for years. \n[/list]\n\nWhich brings back to the main question, why is this called Overwatch 2? (Rhetorical Question, we all know its just for the corporate cash grab lifestyle). When i am alone, ill take any other shooter any day of the week. But because my friends would rather play this than something like Team Fortress 2, or any other game someone may name, my soul dies every other day. \n\nThe moment this game actually gets this shit together is the day im happy. \nI will edit this review if changes actually happen, weather its Blizzard making those changes or my own thoughts change.",

SEMPRE! E o balanceamento de partidas e o sistema de ranqueada finalmente foi concertado, tanto o pareamento de partidas quando o sistema de progressão de elo esta finalmente balanceado, tornando as partidas mais justas e a progressão consideravelmente mais satisfatória.\n\nNa parte de conteúdo, o jogo infelizmente possui preços que podem ser considerados abusivos, Skins e cosméticos são caros e a compra com certeza não vale a pena. Em contra partida todos os personagens podem ser adquiridos gratuitamente simplesmente jogando alem que o jogo oferece Skins e cosméticos gratuitos frequentemente, sejam eles adquiridos simplesmente por jogar ou através de Drops em outras plataformas.\n\nO modo historia, o grande marketing do jogo, é pago e caro, o jogo oferece uma versão gratuita do modo historia, é divertida e bem curta, porém o modo história em sí não vale o preço.\n\nO Passe de Batalha é simplesmente o melhor já feito a unica coisa negativa é caso aquele passe especifico não possua cosméticos do seu personagem favorito, fora isso o Passe possuiu uma quantidade considerável de cosméticos gratuitos e temáticos fora os modos de jogo personalizados que acompanham cada temporada.\n\n\n\n\n\"No geral o jogo vale a pena?\"\n\nSim! A comunidade não é das melhores, mas por se tratar de um jogo online já era de se esperar, as pessoas falam mal mas não largam o game, afinal Overwatch é bom e ainda vai durar por um bom tempo, o jogo vem sendo atualizado frequentemente, cerca de 3 a 4 \"Patch Notes\" de balanceamento por temporada, mini eventos e cosméticos gratuitos quase toda semana, fora a transparência e sinceridade dos desenvolvedores atualmente tanto para mensagens positivas quanto negativas. \n\nRecomendo fortemente adquirir o game e aproveitar ao máximo, a final:\n\n\"O mundo sempre precisa de novos heróis\" \n",
