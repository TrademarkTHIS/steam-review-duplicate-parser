[/h1]\n\nInstead of updating Overwatch 1 and giving it the attention it so desperately needed they pretty much refused to update the game for many years (besides from releasing echo) and worked on Overwatch 2 instead. The game is a huge downgrade and is just a huge cash grab for Blizzard. \n\nThey knew PvE was scrapped but decided not to tell the players so they could probably get some more money before announcing the big PvE mode is done. They then release this invasion mode... a completely dumbed down version of what was promised.\n\nTime and time again all they do is release awful patches, some good things are overlooked by terrible balance changes and it makes the game feel terrible to play a lot of the time. Releasing over-tuned heroes is also a Blizzard classic at this point and it's tiring. This team have barely any idea on what they're doing and it so clearly shows in this game. \n\nTo top things off their support team is completely and utterly USELESS, after getting my platinum border main account of 6 years permanently banned for absolutely zero reason, I contacted support and was wondering what the reason was, I sent 10 appeals and every single one was hit with bot responses. It's been 6 months and I still have zero clue on what I did to deserve this ban, and they refuse to speak on the reasoning so I've given up.\n\nThis is what Overwatch, a game I very much loved for many years has come down to: a joke.",

        "review": "OK, I'm breaking my character of the funny internet guy to tell you to NOT BUY ANYTHING ELSE THAT ISN'T THE INVASION BUNDLE. The only reason why is that the higher ups at Blizzard are trying to squeeze every single dollar out of your wallet, and every our of your free time. The Story Mode that they originally planned for this game is left in bits and pieces and then locked behind a paywall so you can cough up your hard earned cash to there predatory and downright disgusting micro-transactions.\n\n I started playing when it launched back in 2022 without any prior experience with the first one, I was excited to try this out and see why people called it the best Hero Shooter of the decade, only to find a hollow shell of a great game filled with $20 skins, barely any content, and a horrible Battle-Pass with no good rewards that aren't skins and critical Heroes locked behind it. I tried to give this game a fair shot, but the game had other issues as well, like a horrible matchmaking system for casual play, and the lack of anything fun that isn't casual and ranked. The way you unlock new Heroes is also very excruciating. You have to win 32 matches for each new hero by playing the class there from, but you can't do these simultaneously like every other quest in the game, you have to do each by itself for a total of 192 SEPERATE MATCHES THAT YOU HAVE TO WIN. and once the season ends, the new Hero will also be included with that with 32 more matches to win. and guess what, you can bypass this by paying $10 per hero, roughly the same price for the Battle Pass.\n\n\nThe amount of crap that this game throws at you just to come off as a \"Sequel\" is laughable. And we shouldn't be blaming the crew for this. They have been trying there best to keep us satisfied while dealing with the higher ups and there constant chicanery. The only reason why I said you should get the Invasion Bundle is so you can get the game they want to make. And who knows, if we could all not buy anything else and just get the Story Missions, we can show them what game we want, not what we have.",

I really really hope in the future it can become what it truly could be, but it is beyond far away from reaching that goal. Awful handling of OW1 while OW2 was being \"developed\". Repeatedly confusing marketing as to what OW2 is and was supposed to be. Cancelled/heavily simplified PvE, much to everyone's disappointment. Horrible monetisation with industry leading outrageous prices. I could rant for hours. It just feels like what we got vs what it was SUPPOSED to be are just an unfathomable distance apart. Easily the most disappointed ive been with a franchise thus far. I pray that Blizzard realise this and fix it in the coming years.",

Brushing that aside, I think people are being p​i​s​s babies when it comes to how they changed multiplayer in OW2 bc I prefer the faster paced gunfights over the boring ass chip damage, beefy 200000 hp tanks, and stuns that made the first game frustrating. Other than that I think activision are f​u​c​k​i​n​g r​e​t​a​r​d​s for changing the loot boxes and making this game kneel to the OVERDONE AND UNORIGINAL battlepass/store business model bc it just doesn't fit this game at all. This game did loot boxes well especially after they turned off duplicates but \"LoOtBoX bAd Bc YoUtUbEr SaId ThEy WeRe.\" Yes, lootboxes are annoying if they're filled with greed like how EA did it, but they didn't mess it up thankfully.\n\nAnyway, still cringe they don't do more with the game and failed to meet promises.\n\nL Modern Game studio\n\nPlay Persona 3 instead",

        "review": "+2000 часов\n\nСистема подбора игроков в рейтинге — как игровые автоматы в казино. Если победил 4-5 раз подряд, готовься пососать 10 раз без перерыва. И это не то, что от тебя зависит. В одной игре будет очевидно, что силы команд не равны, в следующей вылетит тиммейт или будет тролль, который всю игру фидит. Или читер в команде противника. Игра сделает все, чтобы ты не победил этот матч. \n\nПосле того, как тебя смачно отжахали в задницу, алгоритмы дадут тебе пряник — одна-две победы против очевидно более слабой команды. А может и не дадут, просто страдай. \n\nБаттл-пасс — это что-то на богатом. Накопить на него фармом это приключение на несколько месяцев. Я купил свой первый пасс спустя 11 месяцев фарма. Это всего 1000 монет. А скины там в магазине по 2000-3000. \n\nНо даже при всех минусах, у этой игры нет достойных аналогов.\n",

If you're watching this tape, I'm probably dead– murdered by my brother-in-law, Hank Schrader. Hank has been building a meth empire for over a year now, and using me as his chemist. Shortly after my 50th birthday, he asked that I use my chemistry knowledge to cook methamphetamine, which he would then sell using connections that he made through his career with the DEA. I was... astounded. I... I always thought Hank was a very moral man, and I was particularly vulnerable at the time – something he knew and took advantage of. I was reeling from a cancer diagnosis that was poised to bankrupt my family. Hank took me in on a ride-along and showed me just how much money even a small meth operation could make. And I was weak. I didn't want my family to go into financial ruin, so I agreed. Hank had a partner, a businessman named Gustavo Fring. Hank sold me into servitude to this man. And when I tried to quit, Fring threatened my family. I didn't know where to turn. Eventually, Hank and Fring had a falling-out. Things escalated. Fring was able to arrange – uh, I guess... I guess you call it a \"hit\" – on Hank, and failed, but Hank was seriously injured. And I wound up paying his medical bills, which amounted to a little over $177,000. Upon recovery, Hank was bent on revenge. Working with a man named Hector Salamanca, he plotted to kill Fring. The bomb that he used was built by me, and he gave me no option in it. I have often contemplated suicide, but I'm a coward. I wanted to go to the police, but I was frightened. Hank had risen to become the head of the Albuquerque DEA. To keep me in line, he took my children. For three months, he kept them. My wife had no idea of my criminal activities, and was horrified to learn what I had done. I was in hell. I hated myself for what I had brought upon my family. Recently, I tried once again to quit, and in response, he gave me this. [Walt points to the bruise on his face left by Hank in \"Blood Money.\"] I can't take this anymore. I live in fear every day that Hank will kill me, or worse, hurt my family. All I could think to do was to make this video and hope that the world will finally see this man for what he really is.",

That's why they started playing the second part, which is really just a copy of the first one, which changes practically nothing except for one new mode and improved graphics. The very sequence of removing lootboxes for leveling up your account and paying huge sums of money for one poorly made character skin that cannot otherwise be obtained by using money. Also Battlepass is a mistake too, not a big deal but price plus grinding to unlock things that aren't worth the money when in the first game you could get as much or even less just by playing the game without forgetting when the character comes out you can't play it right away until you buy a battle pass or unlock it by grinding.\nEvents bring practically nothing, the same as at the end of Overwatch 1, the same events, voluminous and tiring, bringing nothing new or extraordinary.\nAnd finally, the balance of the game as well as the ranking system leaves much to be desired, and even more than that.",
