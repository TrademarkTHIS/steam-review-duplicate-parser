Es ist ein 5vs5 Shooter mit verschiedenen Helden, welche alle unterschiedliche Fähigkeiten besitzen.\nEs macht an sich Spaß, nur ab und zu ist das Matchmaking bescheiden (wie bei so vielen anderen Spielen, die nehmen sich da nicht aus).\nDas Ranking System kann ich nicht beurteilen da ich eine zweimonatige Pause hatte, nur zu der Zeit war es Brutal schwer aufzusteigen, denn selbst mit dauerhaften Wins (ohne Lose dazwischen) wurde man meist runtergestuft oder man blieb da wo man war, was einfach nur Unfair war (eventuell ist es jetzt besser).\nDas Arcade System ist ganz lustig (nur würde ich mir eine zweite Seite wüsnchen) und durch das rotieren kommt auch Abwechslung rein.\nIch bin vom Launcher des Herstellers gewechelt und habe mehr als 1000+ Spielstunden in Overwatch verbracht.\nWas kann ich sonst noch sagen?\nRein nicht Herstellerbezogen kann ich nur sagen, gebt dem Spiel eine Chance.\nEs macht Spaß und sorgt für gute Laune (außer man ist \"Ich muss gewinnen um Spaß zu haben\" bezogen)\n\nWenn ich den Hersteller mit reinbeziehe: Hört auf die Community zu verar*chen.\nUnd wegen einigen \"Microsoft macht es besser\" Leuten.. ich arbeite mit M$ in der Enterprise Umgebung und da ist sogar Bli$$ tausend mal besser, also wird es eher schlechter werden.",

        "review": "Now, where to begin on this absolute trainwreck of a game? I guess a good place to begin would be the current ridiculous over monetization. Where Activision/Blizzard told us a couple years ago that revolutionary sweeping changes were coming to Overwatch, in fact these changes were supposed to be so severe  that they \"couldn't do them without a sequel\".  The impression that was given to the player was that there would be faster content release and a whole PVE game mode with stories and ways to level up your characters for those modes. Only one of those promises were half fulfilled, content is slightly faster to come out. Anything of any significance though is behind either a wall of legitimate YEARS of play time or 20 to 30 dollars. A lot of these new skins are either recolors of old skins that were made in the time of the first release of Overwatch, where you had the loot box system. The loot box system was set up in a way where you would get a free one for leveling up by playing, and during events there would be different challenges you could do to get them. Not to mention the weekly arcade challenge where you could get 3 free lootboxes. You could get ANYTHING in the game other than Overwatch league skins at that time. I remember lootboxes being controversial and labeled as \"gambling\" by some organizations and were actually investigated by some governments. The thing is though that in Overwatch 1 those lootboxes, you never had anything guaranteed ofc and on some occasion you may buy 20 dollars worth of lootboxes and you would get every skin for an event, this was hardly ever necessary though. If you played Overwatch 1 for half the amount of time that Overwatch 2 expects out of you to level their battlepasses full of garbage, then you could get every skin from an event. The current expectation is that you spend the price of a full game for a handful of skins or pay 10 dollars for the battlepass and play for a thousand hours while you unlock mainly garbage while you see things in the shop that are on theme of the battlepass that SHOULD be in the battlepass selling for 20 to 30 dollars. Not to mention the predatory manipulative slimy business practice that should be Illegal, where companies have these things in their shop that are \"on sale\" from release and make it appear like you are getting a bargain. When the truth is the price that it is at is what they intended in the first place, they just are trying to condition people to accept higher and higher prices for garbage. You look at some of the prices that these things are supposed to before  the \"on sale\" status is added to them and it is 90 dollars for 3 overwatch skins. Hmm should I pay for several whole games on steam or should I pay for 3 low effort possible recolor overwatch skins?  I think that should be a fairly easy question to answer. Why is it that the lootbox system in overwatch and in video games in general were seen as so controversial and ridiculous, but the whole \"battlepass\" system and locking every bit of significant content behind walls of the prices for full games is not? You could bring up the argument that at least with the battlepass and monetization of characters and skins you at least get exactly what you pay for, but I played overwatch 1 during that time I got nearly every skin and ofc I got to play every character from their release. These skins were on the same level of quality as these new skins and honestly can be argued to be even better in some cases. I spent  little to no money on this game (except for 60 dollars on release). I can only imagine what it must be like for new players, where all of those old skins are behind the battlepass leveling or 10 to 20 dollars. I would not play the game in that situation. I don't know how they expect anyone to see it as a good game to get into. Enough on the monetization though, now to the quality of the game itself. One of the few significant changes made in this \"Sequel\" was the change from 6v6 to 5v5, where there used to be 2 tanks 2 dps and 2 supports there is now 1 tank 2 dps and 2 supports. Now because of the \"disadvantage\" that tanks were given by the removal of a tank, they decided to buff tanks to a ridiculous level where they are the deciding factor each game. Tanks a lot of the times feel immortal and hitscan dps like widowmaker also feel even more oppressive. Because they took a tank out of the game and barely thought about it. New characters that are being released for the game either feel way too strong (Kiriko, Rammatra) or way too weak (lifeweaver), not to mention they made a transition from 6v6 to 5v5 with only minor changes, wildly enough it is not balanced when the same amount of healing is going out that was meant to heal a 6 person team is healing a 5 person team. There is also the fact that there is no Overwatch league anymore, so there is no competitive scene for it. The competitive system has also been ruined, you play games until you win 5 and then after that you get to see what you new rank is. Where in Overwatch 1  you would see your SR go up or down by numbers, other than when you were playing your placement matches that you could get a big increase of SR if you did well in. It was a lot more transparent and satisfying to watch your SR climb. Now it's like you are constantly playing placement matches, but the reward for doing well in them is a lot of times only a tier rank up from silver 4 to 3. I was playing on an old account and I played my 5 placement matches for the season, the game said I was considered silver 4. I played my placement matches for the season and I won 2 games lost 1 then won 3 I did well each game and had the most damage and eliminations most of the time. After playing those games I placed silver 4, the rank I was told I was at in the beginning. I played 5 more games and won all 5 of them in a row and did similarly to the way I did in my placement games. I was then taken from silver 4 to 3. I won 90% of the 10 games I played and my reward was a single skill tier up. Imagine if you played 10 valorant games and won 9 out of ten of them, or any game that has a reasonable competitive system. I should have gone a whole skill division up not a tier. I am not going to sit there and play that garbage game for several days not even in the right skill ranking, because not only is it not challenging for me. It is also ruining the game play experience of the people I am playing with and against. This game is dying and I think we will see the day the servers are shut down, sooner than later if they don't make massive changes to not only their business practices, but the way that they balance the game. I am hopeful and excited for the day I get to read that Overwatch's servers are shutting down. So do I recommend this game? Absolutely not.",

It's almost as if you're voluntarily subjecting yourself to a uniquely unpleasant experience, akin to undergoing a vasectomy with a spoon without painkillers, putting your balls on a cheese grater.

It's almost as if you're voluntarily subjecting yourself to a uniquely unpleasant experience, akin to undergoing a vasectomy with a spoon without painkillers, putting your balls on a cheese grater. The question lingers: why, in the name of all that is enjoyable, would you choose to endure such torment?\nFrom the very instant you embark on your Overwatch 2 journey, you're greeted by an imposing screen displaying two unmistakable choices, both of which seem to taunt your existence - the option to venture into the gameplay or to explore and experience the true definition of Sisyphean task and enigmatic offerings of the store with prices that are true fucking crime. The gameplay experience, unfortunately, can evoke an array of less-than-optimistic emotions. It's as though a storm of frustration brews within you, and saying gamer words multiple times per second is just a reality casting a shadow over your interactions with fellow players, be they, teammates or adversaries. The delicate balance of heroes and abilities that truly doesn't exist. Speaks volumes about how much you can be bad in your job as a game developer. This game is only alive for two reasons faecal matter of players that are so connected by nostalgia for gud'ol days and porn addicts. Both groups are definitions of sad and I am sorry that your parents don't like you and that there are divorced maybe just maybe you were the cause.\n",

        "review": "He tenido la experiencia más inusual al adentrarme en un juego el cual aparentemente, pasó de ser una fantasía erotica a un videojuego interactivo en el que los personajes de repente decidieron que preferían blandir armas en lugar de tener actos lascivos.\n\n¿Recuerdan esos momentos incómodos cuando intentas mezclar dos sabores que simplemente no deberían mezclarse? Bueno, imaginen eso, pero con la evolución de un hentai en un videojuego. La transición es tan audaz que casi esperaba que los personajes rompieran la cuarta pared y preguntaran, \"¿Quién necesita diálogos y trama cuando podemos tener disparos y explosiones?\"\n\nDesde luego, este es un juego que desafía todas las normas. Me quedé perplejo al ver cómo una trama que en un inicio prometía ser algo \"diferente\", se transformó en una epopeya de héroes enfrentandose en un duelo por equipos. Es como si un chef de alta cocina decidiera tomar un paquete de fideos instantáneos y convertirlo en una obra maestra culinaria de cinco platos.\n\nLa jugabilidad en sí es tan intensa como una cata de vinos, con movimientos rápidos que mantienen tus dedos en constante movimiento (a excepción por moira). Los personajes, que alguna vez se dedicaron a actividades mucho más \"pasionales\", ahora lanzan hechizos y ataques sorprendentemente poderosos (como la ulti desbalanceada de junkrat).",

Just one more...\n\nThis. Isn't. That.\n\nBlizzard took that memory out back and shot it. Buy a $20 skin to relive the glory days in Overwatch 2™️ today! (Heroes™️ sold separately)®️\n\nThe game began a slow but steady death spiral some years ago and its debut on steam is its death throes. One last desperate attempt to squeeze a few dollars out of new fans who are too young to know about the game's past and old fans who are desperate to remember the old times.\n\nAs a member of the latter, I installed Overwatch 2 the moment it was available so that I could leave this review.\n\n\"I have been called. I must answer. Always.\"\n\nRest in peace, my most beloved friend. \nI wish it was 4 AM in 2016 again.",

(changed from 25 games to 50 to place in leaderboards)\n    [*]Unfair for new players - Each hero has different abilities, making each one unique. If one hero is meta and locked behind a paywall, there is no way to win. Blizzard thinks they can do this cause Valorant and Apex do it, but all characters in those games use the same FUCKING WEAPON that they need to buy and the abilities are not the absolute core of the game whereas in Overwatch it is. \n[/list]\n\nIn Conclusion, instead of fixing the fucking game, the last 4 years from blizzard developers consisted of: \n[list]\n    [*]Watching Hentai instead of making content for overwatch (watch on big screen in meeting room)\n    [*]Faking work report summaries \n    [*]Scamming their fans \n    [*]Sucking their own cock\n    [*]Having an exclusive cup ramen diet \n    [*]Edging - for training (instead of fucking making content)\n    [*]Cucking - for training (instead of fucking making content)\n[/list]\nwhich resulted in: \n[list]\n    [*]BMI of 99+\n    [*]IQ of <1\n    [*]Copium Addiction\n    [*]Severe Brain cell degeneration\n    [*]Lies Lies LIES\n[/list]\n\n[h1] OW2 is being carried by pr0n at the moment and it is so sad [/h1]",

Мой сын недавно начал играть в Overwatch 2.\nМенее чем за неделю он уже наиграл более 50 часов.\n\nЭто было ужасно для меня, потому что мне уже было достаточно тяжело проводить время с сыном, потому что он всегда был со своими друзьями или смотрел видео на YouTube.\n\nПоэтому я решил создать аккаунт Steam, чтобы играть с сыном. Я начал играть, но это был мой первый раз, когда я играл в видеоигру с 90-х годов, поэтому я был довольно потерян. Я попросил сына о помощи, и мы вместе провели несколько часов, играя в эту игру.\n\nМне это понравилось, так как это было лучшее время, которое я провел со своим сыном с тех пор, как умерла моя жена. Игра в видеоигры напомнила мне, что во всем есть удовольствие, и это снова сблизило меня и моего сына, и теперь мы фактически проводим время вместе вне дома.",

        "review": "Before I say my opinions on this game, I am new to Overwatch and it's whole ecosystem with the launch of Overwatch 2. I touched the original game maybe twice. Once at a friends house and I launched the game one time with the two week free trial Blizzard gave out for the Overwatch 2 beta in April 2022. \n\nOver the past 10 months, I have grown very attached to this game. It is a comfort game of mine, and has brought me and friends closer. Obviously, this game is flawed. As is every other free to play game by major companies. Most of the negative reviews you will see on here are negative due to hatred towards Blizzard, and I don't blame them. Especially with the fire they've been under in recent years. From what I've heard, they destroyed the original game with the Brig update and not being focused on the community. But with Overwatch 2, I can tell the developer team genuinely cares about this game. On a few social media platforms I see developers happy with the state their game is currently in, while also being excited and overjoyed with a loving community to back them up. My point with this is try the game out for yourself. This game might shove a shop in your face, but it's genuinely fun. There's even free ways to earn cosmetics. You don't need to pay an arm and a leg for a Genji skin. \n\nThank you. -Natalie Evelyn",

        "review": "This is one of those games where people will have 2000 hours on file and then write a review about how awful it is.\n\nThis is in the same vein as Destiny 2 where the combination of extremely tight game-feel and robust progression systems will probably get you addicted as hell. Like that game, you'll either be fine with that and play it here and there over the years, or you'll burn out and hate the game.\n\nIt can still be boiled down to \"TF2 if it was modernized and streamlined, for better and often for worse.\" The time-to-kill is about the same thanks to copious healing sources and high health caps, so you'll spend most time in prolonged scraps for payloads or control points, occasionally getting decimated if you're out of position or get completely outplayed. There aren't really any instakills or hugely-damaging weapons like TF2, but the greater focus on midrange damage, very speedy characters, and high-impact MOBA-like ultimates will usually make fights last a similar amount of time.\n\nTF2 launched its matchmaking system right after Overwatch originally came out, so it's a more robust version of that. You'll stream in and out of matches quickly, and it's pretty unlikely you'll ever run into botters/cheaters. There aren't really any dedicated servers though, and the speed of matches means that you can't really goof off like you can in TF2 most of the time (which is a negative for me personally). They've got extra \"arcade\" modes that are less structured, and custom game mode tools, but they're not going to fundamentally change the gameplay like custom servers in TF2 can. What you see is what you get.\n\nInstead of new weapons, Blizzard adds 2-3 new heroes every year. Their team roles are much more strictly prescribed than the relative looseness of TF2, to where you'll stick to the role you queued into in general matchmaking. They've historically been hit-or-miss with new character balance, some have broken the game like Brigitte, where others like Ashe are otherwise fine additions. Recent heroes have been mostly the latter, usually being a little too good (Kiriko) or too low-impact (Lifeweaver) and getting small adjustments over time.\n\nMonetization is the modern Fortnite system of a battle pass with limited-time items to keep you hooked over time, and an item shop where stuff rotates in and out of availability. I find the fear-of-missing-out nature of most battle passes really annoying, with the added \"bonus\" that buying into OW2 battle passes let you skip a ton of grinding to get new heroes when they're released. creating a somewhat unfair competitive advantage for the first few weeks. Item shop prices are also hilariously disconnected from reality; people will pay $20 to play as Spider-Man in Fortnite, whereas paying the same to get a goofy skin for Reinhardt is a considerably worse value proposition.\n\nThe sequel part of it was mostly an excuse to replace the older loot box monetization, which IMO was better for being able to get everything by just playing a lot, but was controversial due to how it pushed some players towards a gambling mentality. A big reason for the 2 was that there was going to be more focus on PvE content like Destiny 2, but that got scuttled into a few seasonal PvE events because of some bad project management decisions, which made the whole sequel song and dance seem even more pointless. It's functionally just Overwatch 1 with minor gameplay changes and a more obnoxious monetization system.\n\nI had big expectations when the game originally launched all those years ago, I poured a lot of hours into it, and I still play it on and off despite the pile of dumb choices Blizzard has made with it. I'm surprised they got to the point of moving it over here after all these years knowing it'll get review-bombed at launch, but they probably know it'll even out after about a year. On the surface, it's very fun and will likely still get support for several more years, just be aware they have a habit of stepping on rakes every few months and pissing everyone off.",
