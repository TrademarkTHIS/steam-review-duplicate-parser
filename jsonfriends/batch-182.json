No.\n\nHowever, Overwatch 2 by itself and as a standalone game is pretty fun. Also it is free. Yes, Blizzard tries to gouge its players but really, how is this different than any other company in the world? Why not play the game for free, and not buy anything?\n\nLet's be clear: Overwatch 2 is a free game, with free multiplayer servers. Regardless of what features you think deserve to be in the game, or how much you hate Blizzard, or how butt-hurt you are by broken promises, how can you complain about free? It's polished, it's fun, and it's FREE! You entitled crying monkeys. Get over yourself. If the game didn't run well, or if it had an insane amount of bugs, or just wasn't good, I could see a reason for the 'Negative Review Outcry'. But it runs and looks great! Blizzard is ass but you really can't beat free, and if you're too stupid to not buy pointless cosmetics then you have bigger problems than your hate for a free game.",

        "review": "1. I paid $60 for Overwatch on PC when it released. Why are you taking away something I spent money on? I understand why Blizzard feels the need to change the game and make corrections but why strip us of the game we paid for.\n\n2. The new monetization scheme is absolutely horrendous for both new and old players. I mean $20 for a skin that came out 6 years ago and was free with the original OW credits, are you serious? This part feels like a sick joke to us original players and is just flat out disrespectful. The battle pass is also terrible but I’ll get into that.\n\n3. Terrible battle pass system that rewards players for paying and gives the people who don’t pay practically nothing for playing the game. I understand it’s a F2P game and skins shouldn’t be why people play, but it’s just dumb to force people to pay for the battle pass if the want to earn anything interesting especially since most of us have already bought OW.  Yes new heroes are \"free\" but free if u take the game as a second job in order to grind to tier 41 in order to get the new hero.\n\n4. Extremely buggy and terrible launch. I don’t even need to go into detail for this one.\n\n5. Lack of anything new, yes they may have updated UI, added some new heroes and maps, reworked 6v6 into 5v5, and made changes to existing heroes, but why does this need to be an entirely “new” game? It feels like the same game to me aside from balancing certain things out but honestly the UI is a complete downgrade for me.\n\n6. Lack of new skins and content, I understand that this is more of a nitpick but like why is a skin $20 when it is basically just a re-color of the default skin? This if for multiple heroes too. \n7. Still requiring specific phone numbers for new users. This is stupid. I don’t even know what else to say I feel like I could go on and on but what’s the point. Blizzard won’t listen to me or anyone else because they are a selfish and greedy company that views their fans as nothing more than consumers (which most are). I can’t help at least writing a review for this game though. Shame on blizzard for this ****",

        "review": "I'm deeply disappointed with Overwatch 2, and I believe the decision to make a sequel was a complete misstep. Instead of improving upon what already worked in Overwatch 1, the developers chose to strip away many key aspects from the original, which ultimately led to a decline in the gameplay quality.\n\nThe promises of a PvE mode, which were supposed to be a central point of Overwatch 2, turned out to be nothing more than a marketing ploy. Rather than delivering a full-fledged and satisfying PvE experience as part of the base game, the developers opted to truncate this mode and sell it in packs for an additional $15. It's a blatant attempt to squeeze extra money from players without delivering anything of real value.\n\nOverall, Overwatch 2 seems to be an attempt to maximize profits from the franchise rather than focusing on delivering satisfaction to fans of the original game. The developers should have concentrated on expanding and refining existing mechanics and content instead of introducing paid add-ons that should rightfully be an integral part of the game.\n\nIn conclusion, Overwatch 2 is a classic example of how to tarnish a good brand through greed and poor design decisions. The developers lost touch with what players truly wanted and instead focused on profit extraction, which resulted in a decline in the game's quality and the community's trust.",

        "review": "Оставлю свой отзыв, как профессионального игрока, который наиграл в эту игру более 900 часов за 7 лет.\nOverwatch 2 - это ловушка. Вы играете в ту же первую часть, но с ужасными ценами на скины в магазине, НЕокупаемым бп и плохой оптимизацией (первая часть шла спокойно на ультрах)\n\nКакие плюсы я для себя выделил:\n1) 5х5. Играть за танков стало более динамичнее (с Райнхардта пересел на Королеву Стервятников)\n2) Бесплатные награды. Их мало, но все же есть.\n3) Ностальгия. Иногда сюда и вправду приятно возвращаться.\n\nТеперь к минусам:\n1) Донат-донат и еще раз донат. Не хотите донатить - гриндите валюту, играя в Овер множество часов.\n2) Баги. В первой части их было очень мало, во второй их прибавилось в разы.\n3) СИЛЬНО урезанный PvE контент, в частности отмененная система прокачки героев.\n4) Новые герои. То, от чего Джефф Каплан отказался в свое время, теперь ввели в игру. Надо также гриндить матчи, чтобы разблокировать нового героя.\n5) Никакой любви разработчиков к своему коммьюнити. Мало того, что старым игрокам разработчики подарили два халтурных скина, причем один из них был скин Шута на Сомбру, так в процессе существования второй части, Blizzard \"раздала\" легендарные скины на Твиче, хотя я уверен, что некоторые игроки тратили свои деньги, чтобы их выбить.\n\nПеречислять могу много и долго. Я НЕ РЕКОМЕНДУЮ переходить в эту игру на постоянной основе, и я не прощу Blizzard практически отмененный PvE, из-за которой впринципе и делалась вторая часть.\nЧто вы делали 5 лет? Ответ я думаю напрашивается сам.\nВ любом случае, Blizzard вас обманет.",

Le jeu en lui-même est juste le MEILLEUR fps du genre pour moi. Ce jeu est de toute manière réellement plaisant à jouer et excellent. \n\nOverwatch n'a pas de réel concurrent, c'est le seul fps à proposer des héros vraiment variés, ils ont tous un gameplay intéressant et amusant, un lore, une histoire, des graphismes très très jolis, franchement le jeu de manière générale est très qualitatif. Mises en scènes, animations, on dirait un film PIXAR !\nC'est également le seul FPS à proposer autant de modes de jeux, de contenu, du PVE, des events vraiment travaillés. Il faut l'admettre.  \nLes gens critiquent mais j'ai beau chercher, aucun autre FPS sur le marché ne propose tout ce contenu et toute cette qualité.\nEt le pire c'est que le jeu est essentiellement gratuit.  \n\nLa seule chose qu'on pourrait reprocher c'est la boutique de skin payante et un pass de combat mais j'ai envie de dire, quel jeu ne propose pas de skin de nos jours ? Surtout un jeu free to play. Ce n'est que du cosmétique. (Le seul réel défaut sont les prix de la boutique et des choses payantes là je suis d'accord)\n\nAu final je fini toujours par retourner sur le jeu. J'ai envie de me faire quelques games tous les soirs, de progresser, les parties sont rapides. Je m'amuse. Je prends du plaisir. C'est le principal non ? \nLe jeu contient de nombreux joueurs et une grosse communauté. Les rageux perdront du temps à venir critiquer et les autres seront en train de s'amuser tout simplement. \n\nBon jeu !",

Ja nie wiem, ale żałosny typ z ciebie. Chyba nie pomyślałeś nawet, jakie konsekwencje mają twoje działania i jak wpływasz na innych. Możesz sobie wyzywać tych, co na to zasłużyli, ale nie można obrażać graczy, którzy cenią sobie tę grę i poświęcają jej czas. I tak wyjątkowa i ważna, bo to nie jest tylko gra, którą można lekceważyć, tak ci się podoba. Nie wiem, jakie masz doświadczenie w grach, ale chyba nie rozumiesz, co to znaczy dla wielu ludzi. Jeśli myślisz, że jesteś pro, to jesteś zwykłym noobem, którego ktoś jeszcze nie nauczył, jak się zachować w społeczności graczy. Nie wiem, co w tym jest takiego zabawnego, ale czep się raczej swojej postaci i umiejętności, a nie obrażaj innych.\n\nJak można w ogóle publicznie wyśmiewać innych graczy na forach internetowych? Ja się pytam, kto powinien za to odpowiedzieć, bo chyba widać, że nie zrozumiałeś jeszcze ducha gry. Jeśli nie interesuje cię Overwatch, to może znajdź sobie inną grę, a nie truj innych graczy swoim negatywnym podejściem. To ty chyba jesteś jakiś frustratem, że grasz tylko po to, żeby robić zamęt. Weź pod uwagę, ile osób czerpie radość z Overwatch, to nie tylko ty i twoje zachowanie. Ona ma swoją społeczność i historię. Ty kim jesteś, żeby w ogóle oceniać innych? Pomyślałeś w ogóle nad tym, że twoje komentarze nie tylko ranią, ale mogą zniechęcić innych do gry? Weź, przemyśl to, naprawdę. Bo w przeciwności do ciebie, niektórzy gracze naprawdę cieszą się grą i chcą się rozwijać. A ty? Nie wiem, czy kiedykolwiek zrozumiesz, co to znaczy być częścią tej społeczności. Widać, że nie rozumiesz, że gry to nie tylko rozrywka, ale też pasja i hobby dla wielu. To nie wiem, jak chcesz to sobie zrozumieć, ale może warto zastanowić się, zanim napiszesz coś obraźliwego na temat czegoś, co dla innych ma wartość. Ciekawe, czy byś się odważył powiedzieć takie rzeczy twarzą w twarz graczom, którzy są oddani grze.\n\nNaprawdę, weźcie się, gracze, zastanówcie się, co wy robicie. Bo nie macie widać pojęcia, ile osób kocha Overwatch. Jak nie jesteście w pełni zanurzeni w tym świecie, to nie wydaje się, żebyście mieli podstawy do oceny i krytyki. Nie chodzi tutaj tylko o umiejętności, ale ogólnie o respekt wobec innych graczy, żeby mieć jakąś kulturę i zrozumienie. Bo Overwatch to gra, która łączy ludzi, a ty swoim zachowaniem możesz tylko zepsuć to doświadczenie. Bo nie widzisz, że twoje słowa nie tylko obrażają, ale mogą także zrujnować nastrój innych. Co? No, powiedz, za co atakujesz taką grę jak Overwatch? Brak mi słów, ale może, gdybyś chociaż zrozumiał sens tej gry i jakie ma znaczenie dla wielu, to byś się odmienił.\n\nNie wiem, może zamiast krytykować, spróbuj zrozumieć, dlaczego ludzie kochają Overwatch. Nie masz tego obowiązku, ale może zastanów się, zanim wypowiesz swoje negatywne zdanie. Nie musisz uwielbiać tej gry, ale przynajmniej uszanuj tych, którzy to robią. Nie widać, że Overwatch to nie tylko kawałek kodu, ale emocje, relacje, wspólne chwile. Nie lubisz Overwatch? To chociaż zostaw innych w spokoju i nie obrażaj innych graczy.\n\n░░░░░░░░░░░░░▄▄▀▀▀▀▀▀▄▄\n░░░░░░░░░░▄▄▀▄▄▄█████▄▄▀▄\n░░░░░░░░▄█▀▒▀▀▀█████████▄█▄\n░░░░░░▄██▒▒▒▒▒▒▒▒▀▒▀▒▀▄▒▀▒▀▄\n░░░░▄██▀▒▒▒▒▒▒▒▒▒▒▒▒▒▒▒▒▒▒▒▒█▄\n░░░░██▀▒▒▒▒▒▒▒▒▒▒▒▒▒▒▒▒▒▒▒▒▒▒█▌\n░░░▐██▒▒▒▒▒▒▒▒▒▒▒▒▒▒▒▒▒▒▒▒▒▒▒▐█\n░▄▄███▒▒▒▒▒▒▒▒▒▒▒▒▒▒▒▒▒▒▒▒▒▒▒▒█\n▐▒▄▀██▒▒▒▒▒▒▒▒▒▒▒▒▒▒▒▒▒▒▒▒▒▒▒▐▌\n▌▒▒▌▒▀▒▒▒▒▒▒▄▀▀▄▄▒▒▒▒▒▒▒▒▒▒▒▒█▌\n▐▒▀▒▌▒▒▒▒▒▒▒▄▄▄▄▒▒▒▒▒▒▒▀▀▀▀▄▒▐\n░█▒▒▌▒▒▒▒▒▒▒▒▀▀▒▀▒▒▐▒▄▀██▀▒▒▒▌\n░░█▒▒▒▒▒▒▒▒▒▒▒▒▒▒▒▒▐▒▒▒▒▒▒▒▒█\n░░░▀▌▒▒▒▒▒▒▒▒▒▒▒▒▒▒▒▌▒▒▒▒▒▒▄▀\n░░░▐▒▒▒▒▒▒▒▒▒▄▀▐▒▒▒▒▒▐▒▒▒▒▄▀\n░░▄▌▒▒▒▒▒▒▒▄▀▒▒▒▀▄▄▒▒▒▌▒▒▒▐▀▀▀▄▄▄\n▄▀░▀▄▒▒▒▒▒▒▒▒▀▀▄▄▄▒▄▄▀▌▒▒▒▌░░░░░░\n▐▌░░░▀▄▒▒▒▒▒▒▒▒▒▒▒▒▒▒▒▒▒▄▀░░░░░░░\n░█░░░░░▀▄▄▒▒▒▒▒▒▒▒▒▒▒▒▄▀░█░░░░░░░\n░░█░░░░░░░▀▄▄▄▒▒▒▒▒▒▄▀░░░░█░░░░░░\n░░░█░░░░░░░░░▌▀▀▀▀▀▀▐░░░░░▐▌░░░░░",

I was obsessed with the game before it even launched. A time when community feedback was of the utmost importance. Monthly developer updates from Jeff spoke to the community and let everyone know where the game was headed and that it was cared for. Fast forward, the game launched and it was a pop culture phenomenon that took over the world. Friends and I obsessively played for 5 years as the care continued to pour in from the highly respected Blizzard devs. Got an Overwatch tattoo with my crew. Invited a guy I met from Overwatch half way across the continent to my Wedding. I LOVED the game. Then Bobby Kotick decided the $$ numbers weren't big enough. The content was choked. We still played though. A little less frequently but the anticipation of #2 had us holding on. To see what Overwatch has become, it's pathetic. World was their oyster. Rumours of a Netflix Show. An entire sports like league I had tickets to go to. Movies. A new PvE expansion. They went with a \"sequel\" though. Clear money grab in all ways imaginable. Hands down the worst sequel of all time. Everything they once built has been pissed away for battlepass garbage. The game has lost all sense of direction with mind boggling gameplay changes. The care the developers once had is so very clearly gone. Trend setting, genre defining game no more. I beg of you not to download or play this game. Boycotting this abomination is the only thing that can maybe bring back the game I once loved, but I'm starting to think it's too late. The world could use more heroes, Don't play this game.",

The original development team could not handle the lightning they had bottled and squandered their every opportunity. Years later, Overwatch 2 is an attempt by shareholders to extract every possible dollar they can from the IP before it is inevitably given up on by the player base.\n\nThe divine spark still remains. This game can be saved. But it will not be. Activision Blizzard, the shareholders and the CEO, Bobby Kotick, see no problem. To them, there is no art to cherish here - only money to be made. That is all it is to them. All it will ever be.\n\nThings will never improve. It has never been more over.",

Also locking heroes behind it is scummy as hell.\n\n5V5 ain't fun, should had sticked to 6v6 and the whole balancing of this game has ruined the fun of some of the heroes, all for the sake of making this game more competitive viable and look at it now, their Esport is dying.\n\nAlso those cosmetics are way to pricey, I've seen better cosmetics for less price and better quality.\n\nAlso blizzard bad, we all know the drama behind it and all their F**K up stuff they did behind the scenes.  \n\nOW pretty much cannibalized every hero shooter out there so either go play tf2 instead or hurt yourself playing paladins instead of this garbage.",

SO for my experience doesn't look to even work here, so great!\n\nHowever I don't need it to run on Steam to tell you how horrific this game has become since playing it since 2018.\nThis is a cash grab first and foremost, some of the worst MTX you'll ever see in a game. \n\nThis game is walking in reverse at any given moment, new content is hooked to get you to come back, FOMO is here in full. Blatant lies around every corner from the developers, one of the worst developer leads of all time. \n\nMcCree will always remember his name change because of your decisions then to walk back months later to almost put real world John Cena into the game \"EnIgMA\" ? Its a joke of a game now.\n\nThere are plenty of other games for you to enjoy on this platform, just because this game is free doesn't mean that it deserves your time. As much as it hurts me to say this... Its about time we let Blizzard walk into the sunset and hope possibly that Microsoft can lead that back to us...\n\n\"The world could always use more hero's\", Wish that was the case Overwatch...
