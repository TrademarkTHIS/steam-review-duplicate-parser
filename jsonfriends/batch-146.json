        "review": "Fast alle negativen Rezensionen hier, sind purer Hass auf Blizzard wegen ihrer Monetarisierungsstrategie. Man kann das auch absolut verstehen, Blizzard ist zu einem Synonym für Gier geworden. Diablo Immortal und Diablo 4 sind eine Katastrophe! \nDas hat aber nichts mit Overwatch zu tun und diese Rezensionen werden Overwatch nicht gerecht. Man muss die Storykampagne nicht spielen, das hat absolut keinen Einfluss auf das eigentliche Multiplayer-Overwatch wie wir es schon seit vielen Jahren lieb gewonnen haben. Also bitte ignoriert die Wut und Cancel-Culture vieler Rezensenten, denn das Spiel ist einfach genial. Kein anderes MMO-FPS hat es geschafft mich so viele Jahre zu fesseln und kein anderes Spiel schafft es, mich so die Zeit vergessen zu lassen. Die Runden sind fordernd, extrem spannend und jede Runde ist anders. Der Battlepass motiviert, auch wenn man nicht zahlen möchte. Aber es ist ein \"Game as a service\", also kann man auch ab und zu etwas zurückgeben für die vielen geilen Stunden die man in dem Spiel verbringt, oder? Blizzard investiert viel Zeit in neue Skins, Karten, das Balancing, neue Helden, eSport, etc. Ich bin absolut kein Fan von F2P, durch diesen Trend sind auch diese ganzen negativen Kommentare hier entstanden. Das wichtigste bei Overwatch2 ist aber, kein P2W und die Preise für den Battle Pass gehen in Ordnung.\nDer Release auf Steam ist einfach genial, mit dem Blizzard Account anmelden, fertig. Alle Einstellungen (inkl. Grafik), die Progression inkl. detaillierter Statistik seit dem Release von Overwatch 1, alles ist da, top!\nJa, für Wiedereinsteiger die von Overwatch 1 kommen, ist es erstmal sehr gewöhnungsbedürftig mit 5 Helden und nur einem Tank. Doch schon nach kurzer Zeit merkt man, dass diese Aenderungen absolut Sinn machen. Das Spiel ist dadurch noch actionreicher und abwechselnder geworden, diese Neuerungen sind also absolut gelungen!",

        "review": "I have played this game on and off since 2016. The recent management of PVE, their bad office culture that allegedly led to a female staff member sadly ending her own life are all parts off my increasing amount of hatred for this game and their management. \n\nThen the game came out I loved it and played it quiet alot, but in it's state and frankly the state it has been in since OW2 was announced is not a game I can nor will ever recommend to anyone. What I presume to be the upper-management has transformed a once great game into a machine made to suck all your money and enjoyment of the game out of you. From Battle Passes to locking heroes away behind a pay wall and making the long anticipated PvE mode behind a paywall just to earn a bit of money short term. Some people might deny this but the fact that this game has even moved to Steam is proof of how badly it has been treated by thous making decisions.\n\nI feel bad for the truly passionate and dedicated talents that have worked under the aforementioned office culture and terrible management of what seems to have started out as a passion project from a large and talented team from Blizzard then it was at it's best.",

        "review": "This game is a shell of the game it used to be. \n\nThe game has gone downhill ever since Jeff Kaplan left. The game has lost its sense of direction and inspiration. Balance is questionable and pretty obvious that they don't really know how to balance many of the characters. \n\nContext:\nI am a Masters ranked Support Main (previous Tank Main) with ~500 hours across Overwatch 1 and Overwatch 2 in Blizzard's Battle.net client.\n\nGameplay: \nThey removed a core game mode from the original game, 2CP (2 control points), and added an arguably worst gamemode called Push. The Push game mode does a poor job at fostering teamplay, as it becomes a series of chip damage until one player from either side inevitably gets one-shot and picked off, making it a 4 versus 5. This is not as much of a problem in OW1 (Overwatch 1) as there were teams of 6, so picking someone off is not as important, being a 5 v 6 instead. 2CP was a lot more team oriented by giving the defense 2 common points to group around. This naturally prevented the defending team from slowly trickling out and getting picked off one by one, waiting for everyone to group up, an eternity that never comes. Thus, the attacking team has to group and coordinate an attack on the defending team. \n\nThe problem with Push in this regard is the team that was wiped has a shorter spawn than the team that won the team fight. This is because the winning team pushes the robot closer to the enemy spawn, and thus the team that lost has a chance to group against the now weakened winning team as their dead members are trickling in from their spawns. This back and forth and how long the map is, plus how incredulously slow the Push robot is, makes the gamemode take an eternity and incredibly boring to play. In addition, the game tries to balance the game modes equally for the two gamemodes in the game. The biggest problem is that they only had three maps for the Push gamemode, making it not only slow and boring to play, but also feel incredibly repetitive getting the same maps after map. \n\nBalance: \nAs I mentioned earlier, they decreased the amount of players on each team. This comes with a lot of balancing issues. As explained earlier, this causes picking off players to be incredibly valuable, as each death has very significant impact on the team. Heroes with high one-shot potential such as Hanzo and Widowmaker (they even added another one (Sojourn) for some reason??) become too useful. That combined with the fact that there is only one tank to protect the backline from them makes the game fundamentally broken without essentially removing these characters (or nerfing them into the ground which they have basically done). With two tanks, one tank could protect their backline while the other could put pressure on the snipers. In OW2 (Overwatch 2), unless the backline is also diving with the tank, they get left to dry with no shield (or meat shield) to protect them as they just try and survive against the opposing tank and damage dealers running at them. \n\nAnother problem arose with the removal of the second tank. The tanks now have to be able to survive as if they had two tanks, so the solution they found was to just give them a butt-load of health. However, having a ton of health isn't enough to make space for the team. They are now essentially a walking battery to charge the enemy ultimates. Lacking purpose and threat, their solution now was to give them loads of damage. This essentially turns the role into a better, stronger dps (damage dealer) role. While this fixes the problem with no one wanting to play tank in the orginal game, they are now way too strong in the current game. \n\nAs mentioned earlier, with fewer obstacles in the way between the enemy team and the backline, it makes it incredibly hard for supports to survive in OW2. With supports having the lowest (average) damage in the game and few tools to defend themselves, they become even easier targets in this game. This is not to mention they have the least agency and the least impact in the game, being mainly a reactive role rather than a proactive role. This obviously made the support role the least desired role. At least as a support main, the queue times are short ᕕ( ᐛ )ᕗ.\n\nSpeaking of queues, the matchmaking is incredibly frustrating. Being a Master player and getting put in the same ranked lobbies as silver and gold players is ridiculous. This is already a huge problem in itself as clearly someone who has 100s to 1000s of hours shouldn't be put in the same games as someone with 10 hours in the game. Assuming the teams are balanced, for example having maybe 1 lower ranked player on each side (which doesn't even always happen), the bigger issue arises when the lowest ranked player is the tank. With how strong the tank role is, having a weaker tank mostly likely means a loss. With their inexperience in team fighting and positioning, they end up either way too far forward being in the middle of the enemy team, or off to the side chasing a Genji for far too long as the rest of team is getting run down. This isn't the tanks' fault, but they matchmaking shouldn't allow for these situations (at least as frequently).\n\nPvE Monetization:\nAll of this and not to mention the entire reason they made OW2 was to make a PvE (Player versus Environment) mode that they later said they couldn't do, and are now saying that they are going to do it... if you give them more money. I probably don't have to say how incredibly stupid that sounds, not to mention that I already paid full price for the original game, but because they made the game free to play, they are going to be charging me for it.\n\nConclusion:\nWith the removal of an essential role and lack of critical balancing that should come with the removal of the role and removal of an essential game mode with a replacement with a vastly inferior gamemode, the game feels incredibly shallow compared to what the game was originally. That combined with their questionable business decisions makes it obvious that they lack of direction and are clearly not focused on the integrity of the game, but rather to milk anyone and everyone out of their money.",
