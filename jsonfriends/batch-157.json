Sometimes you just want to take off your shoes and relax am I right?\n\nAdd a Pajama event where Tracer, D.Va and Sombra are all in pajamas. Without any shoes or socks. I think Tracer would have orange or natural toenails. D.Va's would be pink and Sombra's would be purple.\n\nGive Mercy an intro where two peasants come in and kiss her feet because she is a goddess.

Entrando no mundo do jogo, você se depara com uma tentativa habilidosa de descolar alguns trocados do seu bolso, enquanto se veste de \"jogo que costumava ser\". Peguei o jogo em 2016, e, como muitos, fui fisgado instantaneamente. Anos se passaram, e a UNICORP e suas rivalidades transumanistas nos trouxeram até aqui, uma cidade afogada em desespero.\n\nApesar de manter o charme do design e o elenco maravilhoso de personagens, OW2 nos brinda com algumas mudanças fundamentais que deixam sua base crítica em frangalhos. Permita-me elucidar:\n\n[b]Heróis no Passe de Batalha[/b]\n\nA mudança mais notável, essa por si só crava os pregos no caixão. Overwatch se constrói na seleção de heróis e na sinergia de equipe. Cada personagem traz vantagens únicas, combinando bem com uns e mal com outros. Antigamente, heróis novos eram lançados gratuitamente para todos. Agora, OW2 espera que você traga à tona o grind ou desembolse grana pelo Passe de Batalha para usá-los no lançamento (ou £9 por herói antigo).\n\nNum primeiro olhar, isso pode não parecer catastrófico, mas e quando você cai em partidas competitivas sem o conjunto completo de personagens?\n\nIsso é um aspecto central da jogabilidade, num jogo competitivo, trancado atrás de um pagamento.\n\nJustiça competitiva com um time tendo mais opções que o outro por terem pago? Uma pitada de \"pague para vencer\", não? Deixo a decisão para você.\n\n[b]O Próprio Passe de Batalha e a Nova Abordagem Cosmética[/b]\n\nNão sou contra passagens de batalha, mas comparadas a outros jogos, as passagens de OW2 são risíveis. Cada passe tem 80 níveis de coisas, geralmente 8 skins (com uma bem bonita personalizável no final) e um monte de outros recheios - coisa padrão. Essa parafernália vai desde títulos e placas de nome a emotes. Recentemente, acrescentaram créditos lá, um bom avanço, mas não apaga o erro crítico de incluir aspectos essenciais da jogabilidade atrás de pagamento.\n\nAs skins sempre foram vitais em Overwatch, com artistas e modeladores incrivelmente talentosos por trás delas. As skins continuam excelentes, mas os preços são uma afronta. As skins lendárias (não apenas recolorações) custam em média £20+ cada uma.\n\nElas costumavam ser obtidas por meio de caixas de loot, você ganhava uma a cada nível, o que acontece frequentemente. Joguei durante muito tempo e comprei caixas apenas algumas vezes, ainda assim consegui a maioria das skins para a maioria dos personagens. Diziam que a loja foi introduzida porque o sistema generoso das caixas estava fazendo a Blizzard perder dinheiro - isso é pura bobagem. Em 2019 (3 anos após o lançamento), Overwatch já tinha feito $1 bilhão com caixas.\n\nBasicamente, não há mais como conseguir skins de graça, a menos que você queira moer desafios por meses a fio por uma única lendária.\n\n[b]O Modo PvE[/b]\n\nNunca tive muito interesse no PvE, mas ele era o destaque por trás da ideia do Overwatch 2.\n\nPelo menos era o que nos diziam. No fim das contas, foi um engodo para implementar todas essas novas monetizações. Mesmo após o \"cancelamento\" do PvE, ainda estamos recebendo missões PvE. Mas agora são vendidas em pacotes individuais, só mais um jeito de abrir a carteira.\n\n[b]Um Resumo sincero[/b]\n\nSe você gosta de jogos de tiro competitivos - Overwatch 2 não respeita a integridade competitiva.\n\nSe você curte colecionar cosméticos - Overwatch 2 espera que você entregue sua carteira inteira.\n\nO jogo é divertido, a experiência que amamos ainda está lá, só que manchada pela ganância intrusiva, não posso recomendá-lo a ninguém.\n\nMas olha o lado bom, todas as conquistas do Steam desbloqueiam assim que você vincula a conta, foi uma medida desesperada da Blizzard vir para a Steam com esse jogo depois de tantos anos. E não posso deixar de mencionar que o sucesso do jogo está mais em sites adultos do que entre o público original do primeiro jogo da franquia. Acho que Overwatch encontrou seu nicho mais do que imaginávamos, mas não da forma que os desenvolvedores esperavam... ( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°)\n\n [h1]Se, de algum modo, você ainda encontrará a coragem de se aventurar por essas terras em Overwatch 2, enfrentando a árdua tarefa de gastar seu tempo e sanidade, lembre-se das sábias palavras de um de seus heróis favoritos: \n\n\"Com cada morte, vem honra. Com cada honra, redenção.\n– Hanzo Shimada\" \n\nE enquanto você lida com a montanha-russa de emoções e decepções, saiba que há mais a explorar além das disputas entre heróis e monetização. Talvez, no fundo desse cenário caótico, você encontre momentos de pura diversão e escapismo. Afinal, em meio a todos os altos e baixos, a verdadeira vitória reside em conseguir se manter firme e continuar a jogar, não importa o que o mundo do jogo jogue em você. [/h1]",

My son got this game for Christmas in 2021 from his uncle, so we installed it on his computer and he started playing. By the end of the week he had 24 hours on this game. This was horrible for me, as it was already hard for me to find ways to spend time with my son, as he is always out with his friends or just watching YouTube. So i decided to make a Steam account and get this game to see if I could maybe play alongside him. I loaded into the game, picked my character and world and started playing but I was stuck on what you where supposed to do. I asked my Son for help and he hosted a game for me to join. I loved it as it was the best time I had spent with my Son since my wife had died. This game has ever since brought me and my son closer again and now we actually spend time together outside the house together as well. This game reminded me that there's fun to be had in everything, and it has brought both me and my Son many happy memories.\n",

        "review": "[h1] Despite the drama, is the core gameplay of Overwatch good? [/h1] \n[u] No. [/u]\n\nThe game suffers from visual clutter. In a vacuum, the VFX looks great. But in action, the game becomes an incomprehensible blur of colors to the point where pro commentators can't keep up. But that's not to imply team-fights are fast, healing is broken in this game and turns the squishy heroes into sponges. [i] Heroes never die! [/i] You will be lied to and told the 5v5 change makes the game DM-focused, but actual DM is still rare, it's almost all spam and Ultimates.\n\nThe Ultimate mechanic on a casual level is a lot of fun, it lets even low-skill players have epic moments. But Ultimates begin to homogenize winning plays and overshadows creative plays. It's not even a fun esport to watch. This game design philosophy of making every player feel powerful leads to an ego-fueled community. Everyone's quick to blame but not to take blame, leaving the community so toxic it rivals League.\n\nI've played since Overwatch 1 Season 1 (2016), and the best word to describe the game's development is [i] directionless. [/i] The balance has no baseline, so \"balance\" ends up being this subjective vibe based on how angry forum goers and famous streamers are. Lots of heroes have had their identity and abilities completely remade due to backlash. Symmetra notoriously went through 3 totally different kits. This obviously is a huge betrayal of your time if you tried to master a hero. \n\nTo give credit, Overwatch has top tier animation and art, and is extremely appealing from a presentation stantpoint. But unfortunately this quality does not carry past the superficial. Even if you don't care about the battlepass drama, the PvE, and Blizzard's miconduct, I still consider Overwatch to be a frustrating failure and fall from grace.\n\n[b] TL:DR = Despite Overwatch's flashy presentation, the game is a sluggish, unbalanced, toxic, and confusing. I regret the hundreds of hours I've spent in the game, so I only hope I can save you from the same experience.  [/b]",

Hasn't gotten much better, I think we've been waiting for a Roadhog Rework for like half a year now :/ .\nThe micro transactions are just too much, says lot when my friends are missing loot boxes.\nI fell like I still play on the same 5 maps, and see the same 5 Characters that are just in at the moment because they're strong or whatever.\nThey took out features that no one was hating such as fire, and then had to add it back later even though you could hear the voice lines for it, just a pathetic waste of time.\nThis company has fallen so far from its original roots of the games that I played from the 90s, its just depressing to look at.\n\nFor the good things there's not much, at least it's free, some of the balancing has been good like 5v5 is way better than 6v6, some of the reworks have been pretty cool like Bastion.\n\nUnfortunately this is one of the only games my friends can all play together and somewhat enjoy, so I can't say I don't recommend it because it hasn't completely fallen off the rails. For what its worth, still a fun game that just makes me sad isn't better like it was in 2016.\n6/10",

They removed a lot of great features (that even includes the lootboxes, because you could earn them just by playing the game) and put some of them back in later and made it seem like they want to be praised like heros for that. Of course a lot was left behind. Now you cant really earn anything by just playing. \nThey change the heros a lot of times for \"balancing\", which they can't seem to get right.\nWe now partly have the PROMISED story missions, just in a smaller format with many of the announced features removed. Also it costs 15€, which isn't a lot I know, but it still pisses me off that I paid for Overwatch 1 back then and I couldn't even keep it since they just slapped Óverwatch 2 over the old files and changed the name in the launcher.\nThe whole development prosses since the abandonment of Overwatch 1 in 2019 seems to me like a small studio dreamt to big and realized that it can't deliver, but it's a big company that just said \"Nah that won't bring us any money. Slap a battle pass in there, remove some features and come up with an excuse why you could not keep the promises you made 3 years ago\". Sadly none of the original Overwatch devs, that actually put their efforts into making a great game for their community work there anymore... \n\nI had fun with the game but it's time to let it go and make Blizzard realize that it can't make money when it's customers are unhappy.",

        "review": "[h1]Stay Away[/h1]\nBefore anyone claims I am a bot just spamming a negative review, I preordered Overwatch 1; between my friends and I, we have clocked in thousands of hours playing solo and together. Now, only one of my friends from that group still plays this game. I understand, what was left behind by Overwatch 1 was and still is phenomenal, but the pros in this case, do [b]not[/b] outweigh the cons left in the wake of this sequel. In short, if you do not care about details, I want my money back; or at least them to bring back the servers for the game I paid for, not this garbage. This game will strong arm you to part with a considerable amount of cash, where the original game did not; this game has only seen an increase in cheating and toxicity; this game has horrendous balancing issues that keeps getting compounded with each new update due to the new 5v5 format. All in all, this game, and I'm not even joking when I say this, got most of my friends to play Team Fortress 2 again, and even in the middle of the bot crisis, we had significantly more fun with it than our time with Overwatch 2. Stay away from this game, it is a hollow shell of what it used to be, which is a great shame.\n[hr][/hr]\n[h1]In Depth Review[/h1]\nOverwatch 1 was a fantastic game like no other, even compared to TF2. It was fun and exciting; for years we all would anticipate the drop of a new hero, a new map, new cosmetics. The game has had its ups and downs, no game is ever perfect (especially one continuously getting updates), but at its core, no matter how bad it had gotten, it was still fun. I’ll spare the details as many people probably have said in their reviews, or you may know of it, they had announced Overwatch 2 after a long drought of slow-going updates. When OW2 came out, I was initially positive to it, the new 5v5 format was fun, I liked the new heroes, Push was fun. The biggest problem for me was the new cash shop and battlepass system (more on that later). I personally wasn’t really hopeful that PvE mode was going to be good, and as such didn’t care much about it (although this soon would be the catalyst to all in my friend group leaving the game). But as time has gone on, and as I noticed more people becoming toxic, and I noticed the game becoming stale, it came to a point where I just had enough. So, where to begin?\n[hr][/hr]\n[h1]5v5 and Balancing[/h1]\nThe biggest difference between the two games is 5v5 instead of 6v6. At first, I enjoyed the change, I felt games where faster, and enjoyed the lack of shields that had plagued the first game for years. But, as time went on, I realized a lot of issues with this new format and found myself enjoying it less and less. The truth is, [b]the game was not meant for 5v5[/b]. It literally just makes the game worse in every way and makes balancing atrocious.\nThe reason for this is that a core part of the game’s design is synergies and counter picks. You pick a hero to fight against the other team’s heroes, and you pick a hero that works well with another team member’s pick. The most important role for synergizing picks is typically support and tank. This worked to great effect in OW, but as time went on in OW2, it was clear that the move to 5v5 is a mistake.\nThe removal of a tank causes major problems, the first is that the tank role is missing a core part of the game: synergies. The second is that tanking has now become a boring game of rotating to counter pick and every tank game feels relatively the same. Lastly, this has put a burden on tanking as a whole since there’s only one person to fulfill the most important role now. A side effect is that now, instead of a team-based game, the game has become a tank-based game. Having a bad tank that refuses to play any hero other than Roadhog, or Sigma, etc. will lose you games if the other team has the counter-pick hero. This issue leads to further issues with balancing, but for the sake of brevity, as I have a lot to say, I hope this explanation paints a clear picture on why 5v5 is bad for the game’s health. In short, 6v6 needs to come back, but it never will now that they broke their promise of PvE, if they revert 5v5 they will have nothing to show for OW2 except for a cash shop update.\n[hr][/hr]\n[h1]Cash Shop Update[/h1]\nAll in all, this game is just an update that went away from lootboxes to a cash shop, in theory this should be great—we all hated lootboxes—but Blizzard in their infinite greed has made the experience related to cosmetics and microtransactions WORSE. Now, instead of having every single player on the same playing field with every character unlocked, you are forced to unlock them or buy the battlepass, this is incredibly dumb and makes the game worse: especially since they said, back when the first game released, that locking heroes behind paywalls was a bad idea. And are these heroes worth it? So far, no, they’re all just incredibly mid which doesn’t even make you want to buy them or make you want to get excited for them. Because the truth is, paying for heroes means that if they’re too weak people will complain that they got scammed, if they’re too strong then people will complain the game is pay to win. This is not a MOBA where you have to make a hero pick and stick to it before the game start, this is a game with dynamic, on the fly decision making which extends to hero swapping. This decision once again goes against one of the fundamental design philosophies of the first game. It’s an absolutely baffling decision made by people who don’t understand the game but just want to make more money.\nSpeaking of making more money, the cosmetics. They are atrociously price, $20-$30 for a single skin. No skin is worth that much no matter how dripped out it’ll make you look. Every skin is now earned with money, another downgrade from the first game. In the original, you would play and level up your account, each time you level up, you get a lootbox. Lootboxes in OW would give you random cosmetics or coins to farm for specifically purchasing cosmetics. The only thing to buy was the lootboxes. Say what you will about lootboxes, I didn’t like them either, but I also think the new greedy shop is worse. Especially when you realized they gutted the entire account progression system from the first game and left you with a multi-year, grind heavy, avenue to unlocking a [i]single[/i] cosmetic you want. I could feasibly grind for a skin I wanted in a couple months’ time in OW, in this game, I am left with no choice but to buy the item I want at an abhorrent price.\n[hr][/hr]\n[h1]Misc. Thoughts and Conclusion[/h1]\nI am already on the verge of writing a whole dissertation on why this game is just Overwatch 0.5, and how they keep fumbling around with bad ideas to eventually, and hopefully, land back to where Overwatch 1 was already at. My friends and I didn’t particularly care about the PvE, but we were mad when we learned it was canceled, why? Because, for years we got nothing, they pushed out an update and pretended it was a sequel, then they lied to us and led us to believe that PvE was coming along and great, when in reality (and they let this slip after the announcement)—[b]that they knew PvE was canceled before OW2’s launch[/b]. They led us to believe the PvE, as promised, was coming, when they knew it was never happening.\nAll in all, this game is a dumpster fire, it’s upsetting that a great game that I loved and put so much time into enjoying and playing is being dragged through the mud. And for what? Money. The hope that the people that will put up with it will whale out copious amounts of cash on stuff they could have gotten for free in the first game. Furthermore, I bought OW, that game was not free to play, and they deleted it. I would have been more content with the happenings of OW “2” had they let me continue playing the game I had once paid for, and the better game they had to offer. But, after what I had outlined, I think we knew why they deleted it. Stay Away.",

If they truly cared about their player base they would have delivered on their promises to create a PVE mode with something worth following. Instead you are now expected to subscribe to their philosophy to experience that games story. As a casual enjoy-er of Overwatch and former no life in ranked in the games early years I have to say that I am disappointed with how little Activision Blizzard (Schocker) cares about its loyal community who have kept the game alive. These frequent micro transactions and denial of opportunity to enjoy the game as a free player feel like a slap in the face by Bobby Koticks slimy wet hands.",

They didn't tell us because they knew we'd be fucking outraged and overwatch 2 would flop. This is the most disgusting fucking company i've ever met. Oh yea and did I mention the game devs do nothing to combat blatant homophobia and transphobia but if you curse once you'll get your account suspended? If you play this, don't spend ANY money.

Coming bad to steam has gotten me to play it more, and I support it, but I can't exactly recommend it with the sheer amount of issues surrounding it.  Removing features promised?  Why not just keep it Overwatch?  Why add 2?  This bugs the hell out of me.  It bugged me with destiny, and it bugs me here.  I'll probably play it a bit more, but I don't recommend supporting this behavior.  Don't spend money on this game.  I certainly won't.  Another battlepass mechanic?  It's just the symptomatic flailing of a dying company that once saw so much success.  The sad part is, their undoing has been completely their fault.  Giving into foreign companies in exchange for removal of freedom of speech, removing promised features, cash grabs.  Sure, one can argue this is a review of the game, not the company.  But my reviews are always two parts.  What did I think about the game, and do I recommend it.  The game itself, in a vacuum, is perfectly fine.  A fun competitive romp, even.  But can I recommend it, after all the crazy issues surrounding this game and Blizzard as a whole?  No.  I cannot.  This review will remain \"not recommended\" until things change.  Until such a day that Blizzard shows even a sliver of being about making this game best for it's users, and not min maxing it's pockets from it.  Sure, we all gotta make money, but when it's against the consumers this much, it's just not something I can recommend, even with the game being free.  Maybe, if OW2 doesn't show as well as they hoped with it's steam launch, they'll realize they've screwed up and need to seriously re-evaluate their direction as a company.  It's not review bombing, Blizzard.  It's reviewing the game, and stating why we don't recommend the game.  A game can be well built and still not recommended.",
