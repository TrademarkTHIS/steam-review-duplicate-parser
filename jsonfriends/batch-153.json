The new skins are fantastic, representation is amazing, But Overwatch needs to focus on something else to revive the game.\n\nUsed to be a good game now it is a disaster",

I LOVE Overwatch with all my heart but guess what, this is Overwatch 2.\n\nIt pains me to see the game that I loved so much getting butchered over and over again. No content for 3 years. Awful hero balancing. PVE cancelled. This horrible 'sequel' even managed to make me feel nostalgic over the most predatory form of transaction, lootboxes, because the monetization of this game is absolutely disgusting. I don't know how Activision Blizzard managed to sink this Titanic of a game we had but they did, the only thing that remains now is the wreckage of what it used to be a great game worthy of 2016's GOTY.",

I bought luxury versions of all games and all paid props in the entire store of China's regional war network. I played all the games of Blizzard, but I don't know how much time and energy it took, especially World of Warcraft, which I have been playing for over a decade. I will buy whatever comes out of your Battle.net. I am watching Blizzard step by step on its way to death. In terms of the quality of Watching the Pioneer, I think the first game is indeed a good one, until there are no new heroes or maps updated for a long time, and the gameplay is also deleted.  Watchman Pioneer 2 cannot be used as a standalone game as a second installment. It can be said to be just a new major version of the first one. Countless bugs. Players don't need you to teach people how to play games, we wouldn't die without Blizzard. Blizzard, please seek your own blessings. Blizzard, you will pay the price for your arrogance sooner or later.",

Overall if you enjoyed OW in the past then you should still be able to enjoy it. Only real negative I have is that you need Invasion battle pass to get access to the PvE stuff that isnt \"event\" related. I feel if you had bought OW1 then it should automatically give you access to everything in OW2. With prolly little over 1k hours between ps4 and bnet I will say if you enjoy pvp hero class based FPS games then this is overall a really fun game that can become frustrating depending on how serious you take it. For me it's a solid 7.0/10 PvP focused game that is enjoyable in solo q but, shines best when playing with friends.",

        "review": "I really rarely makes reviews, but this game is review bombed a lot. And i don't think that this game is so bad as is rated right now. Most critic is aimed on change from Overwatch (1) to Overwatch 2. In past was in game lootboxes which was possible getting free, and getting cosmetics as skins, animations etc. Free too. But because of critic, and life-service trends they decided to remove it completely and change to Battle pass model, about which i would tell, just don’t buy it if you don’t want to, but truth is that rewards in game almost don’t exists now. Since game is free to play for new players now, play this game by freemium way you have nothing to lose, and you could enjoy decent team fps with nice characters and interesting maps i think ^^ Another critic is aimed to that most people before it payed and they didn’t get anything back, but it can happens any multiplayer game. Also about locked characters for new players which need to be unlocked (i don’t have experience so i can’t rate it). There was also promised PvE which wasn’t happen earlier, now are newly in game missions, which i didn’t tried yet but i want to, so i will update it later ^^ One of good things is that you don’t need have battle.net launcher installed (but still need account) so you can have this game together with others. Some people critic Blizzard because of controversies too (which are usually real), satirical reviews with compare TF2 better (i’m not saying is bad just different), changed model from original 6v6 to 5v5 where was 1 tank removed and various more things.\n\nBut in summary if you will ignore agressive financial model (which i personally recommend to ignore) of game, and what was original Overwatch what like, i think you can still enjoy it, i'm sure this game deserve more than 30%, at least 6/10 i think maybe more ^^",

It's like a Early Access game, with unreal gameplay polish, deep character lore and variety, tons of different modes, workshop with a fully kitted mods entirely different from the main game, limited time modes and so much else. But nothing really sticks, it all feels like a complex grind instead of simple fun.\n\nI tell my friends ranked mode is mostly herding sheep. Everyone's egos get in their own way of success, but the game is to blame as well. There's so many ways to communicate, but no one talks until the match is over. There's so much happening at once that the game really needs a radar, because you realize your tanks are always going to be blind to something behind them. I love this game, but I want it to become so much more than it is. I have over 1,000 hours mainly spent playing OW1. I hope OW2 becomes better and better so I can put in 1,000 more. But don't shy away from this free game, if you're any bit interested, download and check it out you have nothing to lose. Just so much more to want.",

        "review": "[h1]NEUTRAL REVIEW[/h1]\n\nI have played Overwatch since the beta days and experienced every good or bad decision first hand. From super unbalanced heros being implemented, controversial balancing changes and up to the whole Overwatch \"2\" disaster which I don't really have to explain here as everyone already knows. But this game still is fun for me and a lot of other players...\n\n[b]I still enjoy[/b] the core gameplay a lot and don't mind the battle pass at all, but I also see how terrible it is in comparison to other game's battlepasses in terms of quality and what you get in return, but I personally don't mind that because it's something I earn on the side.\n\n[b]I am still excited[/b] for the new content and theme each seasons brings. They try to mix it up and while Season 1 had a bumpy start with staying in theme it worked well in the last two seasons with \"Starwatch\" actually giving us super cool skins. The peeps that design the skins really don't deserve to work for such a dumpster fire company.\n\n[b]I still get a kick out of[/b] the little character and world building they do with voice interactions during the game or in the spawn rooms. Maybe it's just two heros spitting venom at eachother, someones it's a bit of a backstory or just random stuff. Sure, you'll hear them a lot and roll your eyes when certain conversations come up, but I'd lie if I said I'm bored of them. Overall the writing in Overwatch is superb with how they build their characters and the voice actors knock it out of the park! They need a raise ASAP or just work for a better, more reputable company.\n\n[b]I still hate[/b] that Blizzard didn't learn from earlier mistakes and still balance heros around the top ranked players or streamers and not their general community. Streamers and esports players got way too much influence on the balancing than they should have. I just hope Overwatch's esports league closes down soon.\n\n[b]I despise[/b] that the \"Play to Earn\" system with lootboxes is now replaced with \"Pay to earn by playing\". Again, I don't have a problem with the battle pass as I play the game on a regular basis and will keep playing it, so buying the battle pass gives me something. But for people that don't play on a regular basis this might feel like something that they NEED to do in order to finish the pass before the end of the season or they end up being completely burned out by the end. But at least we don't get community created content only and then have to pay for 90% of it in lootbox microtransactions.\n\n[b]I REALLY hate[/b] that they removed so many features and maps before slowly putting them back in.\nThey scrapped 2 Control Point because it felt \"unbalanced\" but we got Push which is usually just 1 minute of a team pushing and then the rest is fighting for the robot, moving it back to the middle and the other teams comes back and wipes until the game is over, it's just exhausting.\nThey took away maps because Blizz couldn't be bothered to make them compatible with their \"weather\" system which literally just means \"The same map, but with orange light!\".\nThey took away \"On Fire\" while leaving the voicelines in game and even giving newly released heros \"On Fire\" voicelines... and then they added it back in as a big feature of the last season.\n\n[b]And I am angry[/b] that the PvE announcement and everything surrounding it ended up being another \"out of season April Fools joke\" with PvE missions now being put into the game, but only a small amount, no hero customization, skill customization or propery rewards... but hey, you can pay 15 bucks for them if you wanna! Such a sh!tshow!\n\nI wonder how this game would've ended up with Blizzard not having merged with Activision and I still hope that one day Overwatch \"2\" will be worthy of being called a proper sequel... or we'll end up with Overwatch \"3\".\n\n\n5/10",

Not a p*rn video. Not any disturbing form of content.\nBut an [b]IN-GAME[/b] screenshot. Just THINK about this. \nDeveloper bans you for posting \"wrong\" in-game content related to its own game (Thus - for 99% of content)\nAnd I'm not alone in this - basically every user with a hint of \"not right\" got a warning.\n\nI mean... Banning an Overwatch 'Ero' content - is already like extinguishing fire with gasoline.\nBut we're speaking about IN-GAME content.\n\nAnd this - is the company responsible for making chicks like Kerrigan, Jaina, Whitemane, Sylvanas, Alexstrasza, Anduin.\nThis company is rotten now completely.\n\nWe're not happy to see you at Steam, to say the least.\nYou've finally betrayed not only your fans, but yourself.\nNo offense in my overall message, just pure facts.\n\n\nP.S. The link to the INNOCENT in-game screenshot: steamuserimages-a.akamaihd.net/ugc/2047501598604701517/74F5238E1F1F9AF5C78DF0E373F3921D4734062F/\n\nAlso this review IS related to actual game (more on that - in comments)\nI am mentioning wrong product's positioning and totalitarian anti-consumer measures of developer. Basically, 99% content of this game is forbidden now.\nBlizzard just comes to Steam, and spits their fanbase in the faces.\n\nI'm not mad. I am just disappointed.",
