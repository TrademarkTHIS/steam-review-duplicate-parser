With that said i can not at all recommend you play this game. Besides being F2P with all that brings it is just not in a good state. Ranked was made worse, balance is just as bad as ever, and the biggest issue is that you have to buy heroes in a game that is balanced around counter picking heroes during a match. The new heroes tend to be OP so you will be at a disadvantage for not paying for them. I personally think that makes this game P2W as you will be hindering your team if you can't swap to the new broken character. I suggest just avoiding this game.",

Blizzard also killed the PvE story mode and is trying to sell event missions that we had before for free as DLC. Overwatch League?

This was horrible for me, as it was already hard for me to find ways to spend time with my son, as he is always out with his friends or just watching YouTube. So i decided to make a Steam account and get this game to see if I could maybe play alongside him. I loaded into the game and started playing but I was stuck on what you where supposed to do. I asked my Son for help and he hosted a game for me to join. I loved it as it was the best time I had spent with my Son since my wife had died. This game has ever since brought me and my son closer again and now we actually spend time together outside the house together as well. This game reminded me that there's fun to be had in everything, and it has brought both me and my Son many happy memories.",

Ahora el juego es gratis, sí, pero prácticamente todo el contenido en él es de pago. Ah, y si quieres desbloquear los personajes nuevos sin sacar la tarjeta ya te puedes poner Reflex en la muñeca porque hay que grindear en el enésimo season pass del jueguito online de turno.

        "review": "My turn to jump on the review-bombing bandwagon.\n\nA fairly decent video game bogged down by some of the most egregious micro transactions I have ever seen. Skins recycled from OW1 (some of which are seven years old at this point) could originally be obtained for FREE by randomly getting them in a lootbox. In OW2, they are now only obtainable through cracking out mum's debit card and paying the outrageous fee of £20! The new campaign missions, which are apparently mediocre at best, have been split up into smaller 'mission packs'. These cost £12 for three levels and will give you no more than two hours of entertainment. You can buy really great games right here on Steam for a fraction of that price. The battle pass is somewhat reasonably priced to be fair, since you can earn a load of skins, emotes, etc. for around £10. Obviously Blizzard thought that this wasn't scammy enough for them so they decided to also tie every new character to the battle pass. If you don't purchase the battle pass, you have to take the time to grind battle pass tiers in order to unlock the new character instead. It's effectively pay to win.\n\nOW2 is a decent game, like I said. But unless you like frivolously wasting your money, I would advise against buying anything in-game - you're only lining the pockets of greedy suits who probably couldn't care less about Overwatch's livelihood as long as it's earning them money.\n",

        "review": "Overwatch 2 is worse and more predatory than its predecessor, Overwatch from 2017 to 2018, due to several reasons:\n\n1. The introduction of loot boxes with real-world monetization makes it significantly easier for players to spend money on cosmetic items rather than earning them through gameplay.\n2. Pre-Orders: Players who pre-order Overwatch 2 receive exclusive skins that are not available otherwise.\n3. Pay-To-Win Mechanics: In Overwatch 2, players can now buy hero levels, which allow them to unlock new abilities and skins without having to grind for experience points.\n4. Predatory Monetization: The pricing strategy for Overwatch 2 includes a high initial price tag, along with additional costs for cosmetic items, hero levels, and other microtransactions.\n5. Lack of Exclusive Content: Since the release of Overwatch 2, there have been fewer updates and content for the original Overwatch game.\n6. Limited Cross-Play: While cross-platform play is supported between PC and console versions, it is limited to the same platform (PS4 to PS4 or Xbox One to Xbox One), preventing full cross-play with all platforms.\n7. Seasonal Events: Overwatch 2's seasonal events offer fewer rewards compared to those in Overwatch before.\n8. Removal of Arcade Mode: Overwatch 2 removed the arcade mode found in the previous version, reducing the variety of gameplay options available.\n9. Discontinued Support for Custom Game Modes: Custom game modes are no longer supported in Overwatch 2 due to the introduction of competitive tournaments, which limits player creativity.\n10. No More Community Maps: The ability to create custom maps has been removed in favor of official maps created by Blizzard Entertainment developers.",

        "review": "[h1]Buyer beware![/h1]\n\n[h1]TL:DR: Overwatch 2 has potential however given the history from launch to current day, Blizzard is causing the game to slowly die with their decisions and choices with this game, cancelling PvE content, releasing below average to bad content and so on. Making Overwatch 2 only be remembered for the wrong reasons.[/h1]\n\n\nOverwatch 2 was a hyped up sequel to Overwatch 1 by Blizzard Entertainment. The reason for the justification of such a Sequel was pretty much a PvE mode that would open Overwatch to a wider market of players instead of being locked to the PvP market. Jeff Kaplan would be the one to announce what players would expect from Overwatch 2.\n\nSadly when this game released, the reality hit harder than a Missile destroying a Yellow over Comona Base. When players logged on, turns out the game was barely even playable, people kept getting knocked into a login queue even while in games, would see no PvE content on launch, face a number of bugs and problems, and just not finding the game even enjoyable. \nBarely anything changed with Overwatch 2, and turns out that was true when people realized what was going.. Overwatch 2 was just a Store update along with some balance changes and new heroes that'll continue to break the balance in some direction.\n\nNot to mention people also saw a lot of downgrades as well, stuff like Ranks not existing, the icon effects, not being able to see who did best in terms of healing, damage, kills, etc at the end of the match, and so on. What was worse, was when Blizzard had to remove heroes for weeks due to bugs and glitches that made it unfair to play the game, and how they went with a battlepass system instead of a lootbox system (This was believed to be the result of European nations banning loot-boxes due to it being close to gambling)\n\nDespite all the faults at launch slowly Blizzard fixed up this game and soon I gave it a try (mainly cause I got attracted to Orisa), it's not in a good state, the potential is there but there's only a small bit of it. \n\nThe one thing that was holding this game together was the upcoming PvE content which would surely help this game thri- SIKE! Around May 15-17, '23 Blizzard announced the cancellation of the PvE gamemode and it's content and when the community heard the news... They went nuclear so to speak. Due to no PvE content, Overwatch 2 was just a updated Overwatch 1... Oh yeah I forgot, they shut down Overwatch 1 during the messy launch, so you can only play Overwatch 2 now.\n\nSo all Overwatch 2 is, is a downgraded Overwatch 1 with a store update, new heroes, combat update (they went from 6v6 to 5v5), and a bad battlepass system. But turns out there's more betrayal to this game... As it turns out, there was never gonna be a PvE mode to begin with, not only was it confirmed 2 years ago before the news dropped that PvE wouldn't be possible (therefore they were lying the whole time) but they weren't giving Jeff the resources to get this game done thus causing him (and a few of the OGs) to leave the company. So Blizzard execs had this game made for money instead of what Jeff wanted Overwatch 2 to be...\n\nAnd now here we are... Overwatch 2 on Steam.... There's only one reason why Blizzard would do this. Overwatch 2 is a dying game with a dying community, and so to get more money they decided to release on Steam to likely get more players and boast how releasing on steam has increased player numbers. Don't believe these lies, sure Overwatch 2 can be fun but the amount of issues it suffered and continues to suffer will only make this game be memorable for the wrong reasons.\n\nThank you for reading this review, some information I likely got incorrect or forgot some bits of information but I rather just end the review there, I tried to keep information and events simplified since people had already reviewed Overwatch 2 enough times and talked about it's issues, controversies, and Blizzard as a whole on YouTube and other platforms. YouTubers like The Act Man, Asmongold, mo1st cr1t1kal, and many others already covered Overwatch 2 many times and so you can go to them for more indepth information. Thank you all and stay safe.",

The sound as well they changed the sound of guns and some other stuff related to sound i would like to use the legacy sound the new sound is so garbage, there was 0 reason for them to mess with the sound, seems like they haven't heard of the saying \"If it ain't broke don't fix it\". I don't know for me it feels like the essence of Overwatch was lost the moment they released this game i would love to play Overwatch and not this garbage called Overwatch 2, i hate the fact that they forced the entire player-base to play their garbage sequel by completely removing Overwatch and replacing it with Overwatch 2, i paid to play Overwatch not Overwatch 2.

        "review": "As TF2 enjoyer with (1,200 hours) and Overwatch 1 Veteran started playing since 2017 with (3,000 hours) i saying F*CK YOU blizzard for destroying Overwatch. Funny how NOBODY ASKED FOR OVERWATCH 2 IT WAS NOT NEEDED EITHER. ALL you had to do update + care about your game. Nooooo blizzard instead they copy-paste the same game and remaining things good about it (skin/emotes/victory poses/from lootboxes where even if you didnt get it at the time of event you cold later BUY IT from coins you got from lootboxes which you litteraly got just by playing the game/heroes/archive mission which are basiaclly Invasion misson) hide behind PAYWALL remake 3 heros orisa/doomfist/bastion which was basically one dps change on tank role and other two changes new ultimate and abilitys + same map just changed weather from day to night or afternoom to evening and call it new game with later updates of seasons which doesnt change much.\n\ni loved overwatch 1 even to the last day/min/sec the servers get shut down. heroes never die but overwatch 1 does.",
