        "review": "Bought the game on release in 2016 and played off and on since.  I know a lot of folks have their panties in a bunch for this that and the other.  So I will open up with some of that.\n\nNew heroes are in the battle pass.  They are instantly unlocked at the first tier if battle pass is bought.  But they are unlocked for free on down.  And if you miss their release season doing some challenges will let you earn them.  But once a new hero comes out they aren't playable in comp for another while.  The hardcore folks will have the free one unlocked or be close to it by the time they are playable in comp.  Also, the new hero is usually open to play battle pass unlock or not in various modes.  No one is restricted from checking em out.  Yeah, it sucks but it's not as bad as a lot of folks are making it out to be.  And all the talk about team synergy and having options is kind of meaningless unless you are very good at the game a very high ranked.  Literally everything works in the metal ranks which is where most folks will be and the base roster is good enough.\n\nI was never hyped or excited about the prospect of PvE.  I saw it's cancellation as a sign of relief.  And my hopes are they focus more on content for the PvP.  I know I am in a minority here.  You will see folks saying the PvE was the reason for the 2 next to the name.  I just don't care.  Happy the game is at least getting updated and content seems to be coming steadily.  If one actually played through the content drought what you are getting now is like being treated like a king.\n\nMy one complaint is the cosmetics.  20-25$ for a skin is absurd.  15$ would still be way overpriced.  5$ is probably the most reasonable but we are too far apart I feel like they will never come to a price point that is fair.  However, I feel the battle pass for 15$ is fair.  You get quite a lot if you manage to complete it and especially if you compare it to prices in the shop otherwise it's good value.  But it's all just cosmetics and stuff that has no bearing on the gameplay.\n\nWhich is super solid.  To this day the best multiplayer fps experience on the market imo.",

Had over 2000 Lootboxes unopened and at the end of the day while very flawed it was a game with a fair item system, that would give you the ability to earn most items for free. Also sometimes it was even fun.\n\nHere we are Overwatch 2 everything costs double from the first, no free items and grinding for any currency takes month to get a single item/the battle pass. Blizzard had tons of examples how to do it better, they even had done it better before taking the first offline. Promised content wont be released and for small parts of the campaign meant to be given out for free you can now pay. Oh and heroes that when first released are almost needed in a team either require many hours or (again) money.\n\nA sequel releasing completly removing the first part (so you cant play it no more), also removing several features as well as content and not even running at all when first released is just amazing. No one should spend money on a company like this when all they do is charge you and constantly not deliver either promised or needed content. Even without all that they have no clue how to balance characters but hey at least with the steam release you can now tell them how you think about this game.",

        "review": "Blizzard doesn't care about the game, they just want more money. They took away the old game that you had to pay for and replaced it with a new free game that is exactly the same, except: they removed some maps, some gamemodes, even a whole player slot on each team. And what was given back in return? What do they use to justify the \"2\" in the title and taking away the game people have already paid for? They give one of the worst gamemodes i've played in any game with babysitting the robot, a few new characters which will take at least 210 wins(35 wins per character times 6) to unlock all of them, encouraging you heavily to have to pay blizzard money to buy the characters, which have been nd will likely always be META, and a PvE story mode that will be coming out after TF2 gets it's heavy update(i.e. Never, it was cancelled). And now, because of the backlash, they're releasing paid PvE content on the same level as the free seasonal events from the first game(mediocre to passable for the first 20 minutes, and just a slog after).\n\nIf you're coming into this franchise as a fresh player, who only cares about the PvP, it'll be a few hundred game long grind before you get all the characters from the first game. If you're here for the PvE content, go play Deeprock Galactic, Dungeon Defenders, Left 4 Dead 2, Payday 2, or even TF2's free Mann vs Machine mode, all for less money. Or, if you are fine with spending a little more, go pick up a copy of Black Ops 3 zombies chronicles, it'll give you a ton of maps to play on, and it has a large pool of high quality community made maps in the steam workshop, or grab Vermintide 2, which is highly replayable and has one of the most fun combat systems i've played with in any game. Hell, even the plants vs zombies fps games give a more fun hero based PvP and PvE experience.\n\nTldr, don't waste time or money on this game, go play something else, even picking a game at complete random from steam will likely give you a better player experience than this.",

Jeff Kaplan leaving the company before the release of PvE.... until they said it to our faces in a stream it was entirely cancelled (The road map was only there to let us down easily to show us they got something cooked up.... but I assure you, past season 6 they have no plans what to do in the future lol)\n\nThis is why this game deserves the reception its getting at... They promised us a good game with great features and highly replayable missions only for that original vision to be scrapped and its remains sold to us for $15 (and thats only for the first 3 missions, I would've gladly paid $60 to play the 3 missions with my friends if the talent was added)... Dont even get me started about features from Ow1 being added back and they're hyping it up like its a positive thing (Which shouldve been there from the start lmao)\n\nsad thing this game started out strong but due to greedy higher ups and shitty upper management its lesser competition at the time like Paladins outlived this game lol (Tf2 still reigns supreme)",
