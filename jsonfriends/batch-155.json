Whether you are a player of a fast fps, a moba game or a strategic fps there is something for everyone. I don't really main heroes, there are so many and I haven't even had time to master them all 1 by 1, which is enough to keep you busy.\n\nthen there are the very well designed maps such as shambali, new queen street and esperanca are for me third party S maps and are all spread over the 4 corners of the world.\n\nthere are also regularly new events per season, heroes as well as maps which will not tire you of the game.\n\nAlthough the pve was half done, which I don't care a bit because the pvp of this game only interests me I will say that the balancing is an issue on overwatch because you will necessarily be against an opponent who will play your hero's counter which will force you to switch if you don't want to lose.",

They fucked this game 6 ways from Sunday and not even in a fun way, the balance is all wrong now (again not in a fun way) and then double botched it and put it out again as Overwatch \"2\" which somehow removed more content than it added. \n\nLootboxes aren't a thing anymore, which hypothetically sounds great until you realize lootboxes despite being RNG garbage were fun to earn every level and gave you the ability to obtain skins and things. So now that's been replaced with just a cash shop where everything costs about 10 more dollars than it should.\n\nThen there's everything going on with blizzard right now, the fact that putting this on steam is probably some kind of ploy to get Blizzard back in China and attempting to smooth over the utter nightmare of everything else to do with this games development.\n\nBut yeah it's free kinda, though I assume most people here have already played it or know all the shenanigans so I dunno, there's that.",

I'm going to give this game a thumb down with no hesitant, why? because they removed Overwatch 1, or shut it down, they replaced the free loot boxes that you get every time you lvl up your account playing that gives you credit and skins for free, emotes, highlights etc with this tasteless battle pass, which again after 4 years of \"developing\" the sequel of the game which is supposed to be overwatch 2 (which turned to be in fact Overwatch 0.5 because they actually removed content of the original game) hardly anything worth the grind.\n\nYou simply play the game when you feel like wanting to burn time and nothing else to do, for few pointless rewards, and not to mention they are reselling the old event skins and rewards you used to get for free every year in overwatch 1, simply milking people to make them pay real money, not to also mention the slap on people who actually bought OW1 on a full price when it released, not to mention buying the battle pass to play the new hero they release with each battle pass, when in OW1 every new hero was free from day 1 to play with.\n\nNot to even talk about how horribly snowflake the community of overwatch and how the support is just so sensitive to anything, you simply can't even be frustrated when you play, if your team is bad because the whole matching of the game is broken mess, and 90% of the matches are either roll your enemies or get rolled so hard, there are far and few matches in between that feels balanced, and if you actually want to play for free now and buy skins or anything to put on your favorite hero? good luck, you are limited to get 60 credit only a week.\n\nDoing the obnoxious weekly challenges and just not letting you play the game you want to play it, and the classic silly skin for each hero is 1500 credit, so do the match and enjoy the months grind, or just grind the free credit rewards from the battle pass, only to get a classic skin, if you want an actual new skin? lmao good luck with that, they removed older maps from OW1, and added a new mode that no one enjoys (push maps), they ruined the balance of games with the 5v5 instead of the 6v6 which was more complicated and has more planning.\n\nEach team has 1 tank, if your tank is bad good luck winning a game, if your tank rage quit, also good luck winning anything else the defeat on your screen, and so on and so forth, I could write a book about how terrible this game has turned to be else a cash grab and seeing the game actually came to steam desperately hoping for more players is honestly sickening me, but yeah, play it with friends, have fun and all, best waste of time game that you end up just unrewarded for your time that you spent on it.\n\nIt genuinely deserve to be rated Negative and not recommended and I hope Blizzard would realize that and really start working on making the game an enjoyable game instead of simply trying grab everyone wallet for half baked skins.",

Here's why:\n\n-Predatory monetization\n-Heroes behind paywalls\n-Gameplay takes second fiddle to those sweet sweet $20-26 skins\n-Ridiculous balancing (Devs don't play the game)\n-The dev team in general for OW2 is substantially weaker in both charisma and performance than Jeff's team\n-Content from the original title was removed; some of these features are slowly itching their way back into OW2 nearly a year after its launch\n-New heroes with uninspired, bloated kits all so they can cash in on that BattlePass money\n\nI guess it's only fair that I list the positives about this game as well:\n\n-Story/lore is fantastically written (for the most part). It'd be nice to have a campaign with all that story and worldbuilding (Rest in peace Overwatch 2)\n-The art team continues to go hard with pretty cool skins, with all but one of the Mythic skins coming out great!\n-It has crossplay, huge win for those with console friends\n\nMy advice is that if you haven't gotten into Overwatch yet, don't. Save your time and money for a better gaming company",

Ela me mandou escolher entre ela e a Kiriko, me desculpe, mas prioridades.\n\nEm suma, eu recomendo vocês a não jogarem o jogo. Vocês só se sentirão vivos enquanto estiverem jogando Baldur's Gate 3, qualquer outra coisa não suprirá mais vossas necessidades.",

        "review": "Overwatch, the remarkable creation by Blizzard Entertainment, has truly redefined the first-person shooter genre with its exhilarating gameplay, vibrant characters, and unwavering emphasis on teamwork. As a dedicated player who has delved deep into the captivating world of Overwatch, I can confidently say that this game is an absolute masterpiece that deserves every bit of praise it receives.\n\nAt the heart of Overwatch's brilliance is its diverse cast of heroes. Blizzard has ingeniously crafted a roster that spans various backgrounds, cultures, and abilities, making each hero feel distinct and relatable. Whether you're drawn to the nimble Tracer, the stalwart Reinhardt, or the cunning Sombra, there's a hero for every playstyle and preference. The characters aren't just avatars; they're living, breathing personalities with rich backstories that players can discover through animated shorts and in-game interactions.\n\nOne of the standout features of Overwatch is the meticulous balance and design of its heroes. Blizzard's commitment to ensuring that no hero feels overpowered or underwhelming is evident through frequent updates and adjustments. This dedication to fine-tuning the game's mechanics showcases the developers' genuine care for creating a fair and competitive environment, ensuring that matches are won through skill and strategy rather than an imbalanced character choice.\n\nThe game's emphasis on teamwork is a true testament to its brilliance. Overwatch isn't just about individual performance; it's about coordination, communication, and synchronicity. Players must work together to achieve objectives, whether it's capturing control points, escorting payloads, or defending key areas. The level of satisfaction that comes from orchestrating a well-timed ultimate ability combo or pulling off a last-minute push is unparalleled. This teamwork-focused approach also fosters a welcoming community where players learn the value of cooperation and mutual support.\n\nVisually, Overwatch is a feast for the eyes. Its stunning, colorful art style is a refreshing departure from the gritty realism often seen in other shooters. The meticulously designed maps are not only beautiful but also strategically crafted, providing players with a myriad of opportunities for creative plays and tactical maneuvers. From the sun-soaked streets of Dorado to the futuristic cityscape of Numbani, each locale feels like a work of art that complements the game's diverse cast.\n\nThe commitment of Blizzard to consistently engage with its player base is commendable. Regular events, seasonal content updates, and limited-time game modes keep the experience fresh and exciting. The addition of new heroes over time further expands the game's potential strategies and keeps players eager to experiment with different playstyles.\n\nIn conclusion, Overwatch is more than just a game; it's a triumph of creativity, collaboration, and innovation. Blizzard Entertainment's dedication to crafting an experience that emphasizes teamwork, diversity, and thrilling gameplay shines through every aspect of the game. Overwatch has not only set a new standard for the first-person shooter genre but has also fostered a passionate community that continues to celebrate its greatness. Whether you're a casual player or a competitive gamer, Overwatch is an absolute must-play that will undoubtedly leave an indelible mark on your gaming journey.",

        "review": "There is a lot wrong with this game.\n\nFirst of all they have downgraded so many things from the first game only to re-release them months later as a \"new feature\".\n\nSecond, they took away the rewarding loot system and replaced it with a cash-grab overpriced shop and battle pass that is vastly inferior to what you would find in other games using a similar system. You could play this game for hours and hours and you will barely receive anything. They have 6+ years worth of content from the first game and they are super stingy about what they give you. Loot boxes were not perfect but at least with that system you were rewarded for playing. \n\nThird, Blizzard has straight up lied and misled customers about things knowing that the truth would hurt sales. The PVE was supposed to be a single package and much better than the stripped down version we are getting with the invasion update. When the battle pass first came out there was no premium currency on the track like every other battle pass has and when criticized about it they added currency to it...except it was the silver currency and not the gold one. They even colored it gold to mislead people into buying the battle pass under the assumption it would be gold. They only changed the color to silver after receiving backlash. \n\nDon't support this cash-grab mess of a game. An ex-blizzard developer has gone on stream saying the company you knew from before is no longer there, the ship is being run by Activision who is banking on peoples nostalgia for the company they once loved. Spending money on this game does NOT put anything back into development all it does is line bobby kotick's greedy pockets.\n\nI have been playing this game since the first beta in 2016 and stopped playing when they released this low effort \"sequel\" that barely did anything to even be considered a sequel.",

PVE режима, ради которого во многом и делался OW2, нету. Вместо него какие-то обрезки в виде ПЛАТНЫХ PVE миссий.\n2. Добавлены ущербные боевые пропуска. \n3. Баланс пoxepeн, многие новые персонажи ощущаются как пустышки, да и способности многих старых испортили.\n4. Команды 5х5 вместо 6х6.\n5. Те, кто покупал первую часть, просто посланы. Её больше нету, \"вот вам f2p вторая часть, скин Шута на Сомбру и ещё один на Кулака\".\n\nПо-моему лучшее, что можно сейчас сделать - это сделать режим \"Overwatch 1\" и оставить в нём лишь всё хорошо работающее из первой части: карты, режимы и персонажей.\n\nНо более реалистичен конечно вариант, как с R6 Siege - ещё больше ненужных персонажей с пёстрыми радужными скинами, а вместе с ними и донатные боевые пропуска. И это всё будут безуспешно пытаться сбалансировать.\n\nВ итоге серьёзно играть в Overwatch 2 невозможно, максимум зайти на пару карт - повспоминать, как было годно.",

But I've had this problem with other reviews, where I really wish there was a 'neutral' button as to whether or not I recommend a game, and due to such I have to default for 'Yes' because I don't [i]not[/i] recommend it.\n\nOf course, OW2 is just a glorified update - it's not a new game. Blizzard really are just trying to milk every penny they can out of the community and get as many players back as they can (hence the release on Steam) but, ultimately I can only recommend OW because, if you put aside the developer drama and commit to not spending a single penny on the game, it is actually fun for what it is. Always find friends to play it with, have a laugh and make some memories - it's still not too late.\n\nAnyone that wants to party up with a Pink Mercy main or D.Va off-main feel free to add me!",

        "review": "[i]I've been into OW for 5 years. I will try to give some constructive feedback.[/i]\n\n[h1]About the Invasion PVE:[/h1]\n\nI'd like to give the 15€ directly to Blizzard's art guys if I could. The cutscenes were fire. I give them 9/10. The effects, robot animations, effects and design were also very nice.\nThe gameplay... The missions were pretty short, at least on hard difficulty. I bet it will get repetitive and boring quite quickly. It's just like Archives from OW1 with more unique mechanics, if you ask me. Overall 5.5/10\n\n[h1]Should you buy the PVE bundle?[/h1] \nIf you really like OW and you buy almost every battle pass - I would buy it. It's always a good way to farm XP and chill. Additional 5 euros isn't that much... Given you would buy the pass anyways.\n\nIf you don't feel like playing PVP for the whole season and you're just here for PVE then I would rethink it twice, or you can get disappointed :)\n\n[h1]About the PVP (beginning of s6):[/h1]\n\nIf one single hero (Mercy) keeps dominating the average and low elo - this game will be pure suffering. She is a meta must-pick. All games with her are annoying and boring. Every game, you see literally the same comp (forced by Mercy). You need to play heroes that go well with Mercy in order to win. Just nerf that b*tch and her damage boost already. \n\nFor real Blizzard, just tune supports down in general. Let tanks and dps have some fun too...\nEven Paladins does it better.\n\nCheers!",
