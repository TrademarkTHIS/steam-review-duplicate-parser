        "review": "Overwatch 2 has no respect for you, it's an attempt to pry open your wallet while masquerading as the game it used to be.\n\nI picked up the game in 2016 and was instantly hooked like so many others. Overwatch remained my favourite shooter for years - even during the draught of content on the run up to OW2.\n\nWhile it retains its charming design, wonderful cast of characters and some of the best multiplayer maps I've ever played on, OW2 brought a few enormous fundamental downgrades that leave it critically flawed. Let me explain;\n\n#1 - Heroes in battlepass\n\nThe biggest change, this alone put all the nails in the coffin.\n\nOverwatch is a game based around hero picks and team synergy. Every single character brings unique advantages, pairing well with some and poorly with others. Overwatch used to have a few heroes introduced every year completely free for everyone to play. Overwatch 2 now expects you to either grind to unlock new characters, or pony up cash for the Battlepass to play them on release (or £9 each for old characters).\n\nThis doesn't sound game breaking at a first glance, but now consider the fact you can queue into competitive games without the full roster of characters.\n\nThis is a core gameplay feature, in a competitive game, behind a paywall.\n\nHow can there be fair competition if one team has more options than the other? And purely because they paid for it? Sounds a bit like pay to win, but I'll let you decide for yourself.\n\n#2 - The battlepass itself, and the new approach to cosmetics\n\nI've never really been opposed to the idea of battlepass systems, but compared to other games OW2's passes are a joke. Each pass has 80 levels of stuff, usually 8 skins (with a very nice customisable one at the end) and a bunch of other stuff to pad it out - as is the norm. This filler stuff ranges from titles and nameplates to emotes. I believe they've recently added credits in there, which is a great step forward, but doesn't undo the aforementioned critical misstep of including core gameplay features behind a paywall.\n\nCosmetics have always been a huge part of Overwatch, the skins are designed by insanely talented artists with equally talented modellers. These skins continue to be fantastic, but the prices are insulting. Legendary skins (ones that aren't just recolours) are on average around £20+ each.\n\nThese used to be obtained via lootboxes, you'd get one every level up which tends to be insanely frequent. In my time playing I only bought boxes on a few occasions and still managed to get most skins for most characters. Most people's argument for them bringing in the store was that the generous lootbox system was losing them money - this is simply wrong. In 2019 (3 years after launch) Overwatch had already made $1billion via lootboxes.\n\nThere's now essentially no free way to get skins, unless you want to grind challenges for months on end for a single legendary.\n\n#3 - The PvE\n\nI never had too much interest in the PvE - but it was the driving point behind the whole idea of Overwatch 2.\n\nThat's what we were told anyway, it ended up just being a bait and switch to implement all these new monetisation systems. Hell, even after the \"cancellation\" of PvE we're still getting PvE missions? Except they're now being sold as individual packs, just another way to squeeze your wallet.\n\nIn Summary\n\nIf you like competitive shooters - Overwatch 2 has no competitive integrity.\n\nIf you like collecting cosmetics - Overwatch 2 expects you to hand over your entire wallet\n",

Blizzard takes all the bad parts of Free-2-Play games with none of the good to maximize profit per second. Never-mind DPS Blizzard wants the PPS. As someone that has supported Blizzard for many years from the time of Warcraft 2, Diablo 1 and Starcraft I am very saddened by the state of this company. Once a highly respected game company is now only a shadow of it's former self. Please do not give money to Blizzard until they start respecting their fans.",

Никакая дополнительная цифра в названии это не изменит.\nЯ не жалею потраченные сотни часов.

OW2 is just a lazy cash grab scam, it’s literally ow1 with a new logo and UI. All it brought to the table was a rework that took years to think of that ruined the game further if anything and the price was having no heros or maps or decent changes for a long while till this sorry excuse of a “game” released. You can sum it up to “overwatch 2: the battle pass” cuz after everything it just felt like they made the game 5v5 instead of 6v6 and added more mtx and a battle pass.",

Their is no sense of progression if you don't open your wallet unless you count rank which then the people who paid for the battle pass have the advantage since they have heroes there and they are usually strong on launch. They also lied about having a premium campaign and instead make us by them in packs which don't add much to the game. I played this game at first with the expectation that they would have a campaign and now that it is gone and replaced with an inferior version I see no reason to play other then if you want to feel sad about how far Blizzard has fallen.",

        "review": "战网没有国服，肯定全是暴雪的责任。\n\n想想15年前，2008年，正是全国人民迎接奥运的重要年份。那时候魔兽世界只是一个名不见经传的小游戏，暴雪也只是一个游戏小作坊。当时暴雪为了国服战网的存续绞尽脑汁，因为没有公司愿意接手这样的小成本低质量的网游。而当时全世界瞩目的游戏巨头网易，是创造了高质量3A神作《大话西游》的原创良心公司，是游戏从业者们人人趋之若鹜的理想殿堂。暴雪主动抛出橄榄枝给网易，签了一份非常利好于网易的长期合作协议；毕竟，有网易这种游戏巨头愿意赏识，是抬举你暴雪，难道这合同还能有利于你小小暴雪不成？\n\n谁能想到，暴雪自从被动视收购之后，越做越强，在动视优秀的总裁鲍比考迪克先生充满睿智的领导下，早已经不再是昔日的小作坊了。而在和网易合作的15年之后，暴雪开始觉得如今财大气粗，拥有显赫江湖地位的自己，再也不是当年的吴下阿蒙了；终于决定在国服战网的续约问题上，和网易一转攻势。\n\n大家千万别听信暴雪天天在公众平台散播的舆论造势，说什么是网易狮子大开口，在续约问题上想要压榨暴雪，所以谈崩了。我们大天朝的网民，都是擅长理性思考的，什么谣言都是一眼丁真，当场看破其中隐秘，哪次有过盲目跟风这种事？塑造一副暴雪傻白甜，纯纯受害者的样子，装给谁看呢？\n\n15年前，你暴雪小作坊，求着我们网易合作，那合同肯定是利好于网易的；15年后，你暴雪做大了，想要更多蛋糕分；狮子大开口的人，肯定是你暴雪啊。但凡动动脑子，都能明白这么简单的道理，我们充满智慧的天朝网友能看不明白吗？当场戳破你暴雪可笑的把戏！还在互联网上妄想抹黑网易要价高？省省吧你！网易巴不得是15年前那个利益分成呢，毕竟当年是你暴雪求着网易签的合同，让利的是你暴雪。\n\n再说说游戏品质，暴雪游戏入华以来，一直都是以低质量低可玩性著称的。而网易在扶持暴雪上，投入了太多太多。不管是08年之前第九城市运营时期，还是08年之后网易运营时期，暴雪游戏在全世界10多个地区的各种语言的本地化开发和支持上，都是网易全权负责的。正是因为网易尽心尽力，才能让暴雪游戏在全世界各个地区都保持着统一高质量的本地化水平。不得不感谢网易真的是对暴雪仁至义尽了，明明只运营一个国服，却帮你暴雪把全世界都打点好了。全体国服玩家也不得不感谢网易，没有网易，就带不来这全世界几乎是最好的本地化游戏体验。\n\n而暴雪呢，却坏事做尽。作为一个小作坊，不光不好好学习游戏巨头网易的成功经验，还大搞内购系统。暴雪游戏几乎全都充斥着重度氪金的情况，pay to win这种令很多玩家厌恶至极的游戏运营模式，却成为了暴雪的拿手好戏。而为了和暴雪自主运营的全球服高度同步，暴雪甚至还强迫网易把“氪金就会变强”这种不公平不良心坑害玩家的系统带入到了国服战网。如今游戏圈氪金系统成风的糟糕环境，正是暴雪这种美其名曰游戏公司的行业蛀虫造成的。记得当时网易方面的负责人张某还在微博公开谈论过此事：“为什么不学学我们网易在《大话西游》、《梦幻西游》、《逆水寒》等等好玩又良心的网游上的成功经验呢？明明不氪金也可以让全世界这么多玩家喜欢，真的是替暴雪感到遗憾和惋惜。”\n\n回顾2016年，暴雪做出了强调氪金系统又非常不好玩的守望先锋这款游戏。看看此时游戏巨头网易在做什么？划时代的国风良心手游巨作《阴阳师》登场了！一次性购买付费，不需要任何氪金，也能通过不断地游戏获取箱子开出游戏内的全部道具。游戏本身也好玩，而且是纯纯的中国元素，可以说《阴阳师》是早期中国文化输出的经典代表了。奈何当时的互联网环境，普遍国人还没那么自信。网易逆市而动，勇气可嘉，但商业战略不足。最终这款为中国人打造的国风游戏，却在异国他乡的日本大放异彩，可以说是扬我国威了。奈何国人自己却对充满了自家文化的《阴阳师》丝毫不感冒，只能是墙里开花墙外香，有些遗憾了。如果当时的国人能再文化自信一点，《阴阳师》就是骄傲的国产之光了。那还有原神什么事儿？\n\n人们常说，不要听一个人说了什么，而是要看他做了什么。\n\n暴雪游戏进入中国这二十来年，从奥美时代，到九城时代，再到网易时代，推出了各式各样的垃圾游戏来坑害我们中国人的金钱和时间，给了我们最差的游戏体验。不管是星际争霸，暗黑破坏神，魔兽争霸3，还是魔兽世界，炉石传说，守望先锋，哪个不是氪金就会变强的pay to win运营模式？暴雪游戏有一个算一个，制作质量都很差，玩起来又不好玩，全是山寨别人家的游戏内容，汉化还全是机翻，都是中国玩家的童年阴影。\n\n反观网易，虽然代理了暴雪全家桶这种糟糕经历，是作为良心游戏产商而言不可磨灭的污点；但在自主研发这一块上，网易绝对是带给了全国人民最好的游戏阵容。不管是早期被石器时代和魔力宝贝等日本垃圾网游深度模仿的大话西游、梦幻西游，还是后来的极其良心，被天涯明月刀等游戏严重抄袭，不花钱就能爽快呼吸的逆水寒，都是中国原创游戏史上里程碑式的存在。好玩，良心，高质量，就是网易游戏的代名词。至于垃圾游戏永劫无间？那虽然是网易旗下的没错，但那可是独立工作室制作的，没有网易的监督，结果不管是从玩法，从质量上，都是网易产品线里最垃圾的一款。强就强在网易强大的运营能力，能把这样一款独立工作室的低质量垃圾游戏，靠一手神仙运营给盘活了。这点上不得不感谢网易。\n\n对比一下就知道，暴雪在互联网上胡说八道，颠倒黑白的舆论造势都是掩耳盗铃的小丑把戏罢了。你以为我们慧眼如炬的的中国网友，会上你的当，盲目跟风讨伐网易吗？笑话！想想你都做过什么吧，一款拿得出手能和网易掰手腕的游戏都没有，也配叫游戏公司？真以为你纯靠骗钱能力强，财大气粗，就能搬弄是非，黑的说成白的？省省吧你暴雪！\n\n在国服续约谈崩这事上，我站网易，因为他是有良心的中国游戏公司。暴雪不过是傲慢的白皮猪，来坑我们中国人钱的，也好意思狮子大开口？\n\n真的很心疼动视暴雪现在独木难支，以良心企业家鲍比考迪克为首的管理团队，有暴雪这种垃圾游戏公司在，真的是再好的管理层都救不活！\n希望有游戏从业者精神，有良知的鲍比考迪克先生，和有着同样气质的我们中国人的骄傲，网易公司，能一起蒸蒸日上，万寿无疆。\n\n挺你们。",

        "review": "Overwatch 2, the follow-up to the popular shooter from 2016, has some good parts but also some big problems. The game still looks nice, has cool characters, and fun multiplayer maps, but a bunch of important changes have made it less fun.\n\nOne big problem is that now you have to either pay money or spend a lot of time to get new characters. This makes the game unfair in competitive mode, where having more options can give some players an advantage just because they paid.\n\nAnother big selling point of Overwatch 2's new balance was the removal of stuns which they have now slowly been readding which creates the same pitfalls that Overwatch 1 ran into, causing the identical problems that they decided to create Overwatch 2 for.\n\nThey also promised PvE content, but they changed their minds and are using it to make more money too. They're selling parts of the game that were supposed to be included while also heavily reducing the scope and quality. A big note with that is that PvE mission can also not be bought with ingame *paid* currency. If you own 25€ worth of credits that you once purchased these are not valid, you need to once again pay 15€ more to access these missions which is a tactic you would usually expect from dying games.\n\nOverall, Overwatch 2 still has moments of fun, but these problems with fairness and money-grabbing make it hard to recommend. If you like competitive games, you might feel like you have to pay to win. If you like collecting cool things in the game, get ready to spend a lot of money. The game still has good parts, but these money-focused changes take away from the core gameplay.",

        "review": "I've got close to 900 hours in Overwatch, this used to be one of my favorite games. But it's a soulless, empty shell of what it once was. Blizzard saw the launch of Halo Infinite and thought to themselves [i]\"how do we do that, but worse?\"[/i] Here are just some of the many, many terrible things about this game:\n\n[list]\n[*]The change to 5v5 is terrible. The Overwatch team has never been very good at balancing the game, and it would always get stuck in some meta that made the game stale. In the last couple years of its life, OW was stuck in a \"double shield\" meta. The team tried a few times to work around this by nerfing shields, buffing DPS characters, etc, but they could never get it right. So they gave up and switched to 5v5, completely eliminating one tank from the team. They also reworked several characters as well (like Orisa, who no longer has a shield). But this also had the side effect of making the balance even worse, as half the characters are now useless. DPS heroes shred everything. Supports are just DPS heroes who can heal on the side. Tanks aren't even tanks anymore, they're just DPS heroes with bigger hitboxes. The whole thing is a mess.\n\n[*]Blizzard didn't bother updating the original Overwatch for around 2 years because they were busy working on OW2. They claimed they needed a new engine for fancy things like environmental effects and lighting. There's nothing in the current game that couldn't have been done in the old engine, and we likely won't ever see any of those fancy environmental effects because they gutted the planned PVE. In fact, switching to a new engine broke a ton of things, and it took them around 9 months to reimplement even the most basic things (like the On Fire system).\n\n[*]Did I mention the PVE was gutted? The mode that was gonna have all the tech trees for individual heroes was completely scrapped, and so now they're trying to salvage the PVE by shoving what little they made into the game for $15 each season. Yes, you read that right. $15 and they're not even included with the season pass. You get one free mission (at least this season anyway), although, after playing it...I think I understand why the higher-ups decided to scrap most of the PVE. The new mission, Underworld, is basically just another Overwatch Archives event. You stand on a point, shoot endless waves of braindead AI, and wait until the game tells you to move. Then you run a very short distance to the end point and repeat the process. Takes about 15 minutes on easy mode, and higher difficulties only take longer because the enemies turn into bullet sponges. It is [i]incredibly[/i] dull, and if this is the quality of their PVE stuff, it's certainly not worth the time or money.\n\n[*]The monetization is horrendous. The skins are ludicrously overpriced, generally sitting at around $20. They also try to rip off new players who don't know any better by charging $15 for skins that are years old. The quality of the skins also varies wildly (both in the shop and battle pass). Sometimes the epic skins have more effort put into them than the legendary skins, and they [i]love[/i] to reskin the default skins and pretend they're worth something. \n\n[*]The battle pass is one of the worst I've ever seen (well, aside from Halo Infinite). If you played the original OW, you'll remember how the loot boxes were full of garbage padding like sprays and voice lines. Well, the battle pass does the same thing, only to an even worse degree. You also get low effort crap like weapon charms (little keychains to stick on your weapons) and \"souvenirs\" (static models your character holds up like a lazy emote). Their fancy new mythic skins were originally at the very final tier of the battle pass, but they've recently changed this. The mythic skins now sit at the halfway point in the battle pass, and I strongly suspect this is because nobody was bothering to finish the stupid things. They've also started handing out battle pass level skips in Prime Gaming, which is another indicator that nobody is finishing the battle pass. Which also might be why they've moved the game to Steam, they're probably desperate for new players.\n[/list]\n\nI could go on forever about how they've ruined Overwatch, or how Blizzard is a terrible company. But the tl;dr is that you shouldn't touch this. Even when OW1 was languishing for two years without any updates, it was still better than this garbage. Overwatch had so much potential and the idiots kneecapped their own franchise.",
