        "review": "alright, it has to be said: fighting games are categorically bad.\nthey're so fucking unenjoyable. they ALL are pure brain poison that punishes you for missing an arbitrary 50 button combo and has the SINGLE WORST character movement of any video game genre. every movement button either completely changes your moves or gets misread. imagine making a non-platformer game where JUMPING SIDE TO SIDE is the most precise way to get around and god help you if you want to attack AND move. 0 people are actually capable of the kind of perfect input required to do anything outside of button-mashing while relying on visual queues. you either spend hours non-stopping practicing perfect inputs to get the timings right or are button-mashing in all but name. no one is actually \"good\" at fighting games, they've just learned the order of buttons they should hit for whatever one character they've locked themselves into in the game and hit it over-and-over as fast as possible and claim victory/defeat. and that's probably the worst aspect design-wise: it is UNFATHOMABLE to me that an entire genre of game exists where the selling point is the amount and diversity of playable characters, but playing any more than one of them at any point reduces your gameplay to spray-and-pray compare that to racing games, which also have the prime selling point of the amount and diversity of usable vehicles, but the skills associated with each one viably translate out to any other vehicle build. spending time with a certain build obviously makes you better with it, but switching between vehicles isn't *literally certain* to handicap your ability to play at the same level, the way that switching between fighters does in ANY fighting game. and this is a genre-wide problem: mortal kombat, soulcalibur, smash bros, etc. fighting games either have diversity among characters and suffer gameplay wise, or are incentivized to make all characters play similarly. for example, \"Alien\", from the Alien movie and game franchise, could be the absolute coolest character in any fighting game, but instead in mortal kombat it's just a humanoid bipedal fighter with a tail. they HAD to make it play similarly too other characters for gameplay to be viable, which sacrifices all the coolest potentials of adding a literal xenemorph to the game, while making its moveset as dull are arbitrary as any other, but with cool graphics. it's so fucking frustrating that there's no way to make a fighting game with diverse characters without having the act of playing any character over your \"main\" completely compromise gameplay. fighting games are just categorically unfixable in terms of game design and balance. not one adult has even a single healthy relationship with another human being and enjoys playing fighting games. but the movement in fighting games holy shit it's so fucking bad. trying to control where your character is in a fighting game is like throwing your shit at an industrial sized fan, while getting hit by the backblast of an RPG, while hanging upside down the best i've ever seen is either Dragonball's flying or SoulCalibur's 3D dodging. any genre where the highest quality games are Dragonball and SoulCalibur doesn't deserve the embarrassment of existing. like FFS fighting in Dragonball is a fucking chore and shouldn't even be considered fighting as much as chasing in circles. and if you play smash you're honestly just a pedophile. straight up. that shit is so fucking weird to me; it's an inconsistent mess of characters from different universes with 0 attempt at game balance that requires hundreds of hours of practice per character to get ANY enjoyment meanwhile it has like what? 50 characters? idek because it's so fucking boring that i'd never waste my time paying it attention. it should be a crime to market it game on its range of characters while having that kind of NECESSARY per-character time-investment like jesus fucking christ, if you actually know the down+b for every smash character i seriously hope you see a therapist, for your own sake and for the sake of the 9 year olds who these games are made for if improving skill at fighting enemies in video games is the enjoyment someone is looking for, dark souls or even batman: arkham night or any spider-man game is infinitely less rage enduring and requires WAYYY less time investment. and that's not to mention games that co-center world exploration like the witcher or assassins creed i'm obviously just raging out over the 1's and 0's i don't like at this point, but i'm actually mind-blown that anyone would spend their time in shitty fighting simulators when they could be playing a game with MORE CONTROL over the fights and other content. like even fucking Watch Dogs is more fun to me, and those games are ass, but at least when i press a button i know what it does and it does it consistently and predictably i cannot imagine coming home and thinking \"oh, i know what sounds like fun, trying to win a competition based on my ability to reproduce a 50-button sequence completely from muscle memory\" i'd rather just blast my mind with xanax and build a house in minecraft LMAO and for fucks sake playing against a sweat-lord who's put in a thousand hours into one of these fighting games (but hasn't ever played more than two of the 50 characters lol) is objectively worse than human torture. you ALWAYS just end in either a grab/throw spiral or bouncing up and down like a piñata without ANY control of your character whatsoever. HOW IS THAT FUN? even for the sweat-lord cheeto man doing the juggling, HOW IS THAT FUN? god they're repugnant af when i regain control of my emotions i'm gonna look over this thread again and try to psychoanalyze and synthesize the reasons i hate fighting games into a coherent message... might even write a medium article lol last post in this thread is a genuine plea: can someone tell me 1 reason to play a fighting game over a racing game or call of duty zombies or any 2+ player platformer or coop-rpg?",

Но если не брать во внимание все эти нюансы насчет скинов, то у нас вроде бы есть персонаж, дамага от скинов больше не будет, вам дали бесплатную игру с крутым геймплеем, хватит наяривать на скины. Обидно конечно, но что поделать, навернем отборной коричневой массы, проглотим и потерпим, может что-то да когда-нибудь изменится. Могу точно сказать что это просто прекрасная игра, в которой можно посидеть и позалипать вечерками с друзьями. Всё же есть в ней что-то, что цепляет. \nСейчас добавили прогрессию для персонажей, на мой взгляд это очень интересная штука чтобы остаться в игре на подольше (Люблю статистику и всё что с ней связано). Если нужно получить фан от игры, то она запросто это даст, все динамично, красочно. Если хочется попотеть, то тоже можно устроить, только вот подбор матчей в рейтинге на высоких рангах долговатый, но можно во время поиска и побегать на ДМе.\nВ общем и целом это достаточно хорошая бесплатная игра, которая может скрасить ваши вечера и подарить кучу положительных эмоций.",

        "review": "I originally started playing on console when this game first came out back in 2016. I switched to PC around Ana's release and played ranked OW (Diamond Support main) nearly everyday until the release of Ash, by which point I started playing other games and wasn't as dedicated to OW. By this point I'd only play during the seasonal/story events. I almost quit playing entirely once OW2 was announced and the devs left OW1 in limbo for three years. I didn't stop playing because I didn't like the game; I still found it fun from time to time. But the extremely toxic community and lack of meaningful content and updates had me looking to other games to scratch my competitive itch.\n\nOverwatch 2 was supposed to revitalize both the game and the community. Blizzard promised us a brand-new expansive PvE experience and a revamped PvP. Instead, we got a half-baked balance update (the only real meaningful change was the removal of one tank role), three new heroes, and a few new maps. What has Blizzard been doing the entire time while they left OW1 to wither and rot? \n\nBlizzard decided to make OW2 free-to-play and it's just as you would expect it to be: grindy battle passes with sub-par items that no one cares for, an overpriced premium shop to spend $20+ on skins, and a slow drip-feed of content to keep gamers coming back to spend more money. I am *not* a fan of battle passes. I don't want to feel obligated to dedicate hours of my life grinding a game for fear of missing out on items that I payed for. I hate having to do challenges that forces me to play content I never cared to do in the first place; playing roles I don't like, playing game modes I don't want to play. And then there's the shop. I wouldn't mind the shop if the items were reasonably priced, but I'm not paying over $20 for a single skin for a character in a game where swapping heroes mid-match is needed and encouraged. The worst part about this isn't even the pricing, either. It's the fact that you can no longer *earn* the new cosmetics anymore. Say what you will about loot boxes in gaming, Blizzard actually did it right with OW1. You earn loot boxes every time you level up. And if you wanted more loot boxes, you can just buy them. You didn't need to buy boxes if you didn't want to. I never spent a dime on them. Everything I had pre-OW2 I had earned. Now if you want any cosmetics, you *have* to buy them, either through the shop or the battle pass. \n\nRanked OW2 is a literal crapshoot. Blizzard decided to hide everyone's SR and now you can't see if you move up or down in ranking. A reasonable person would assume,\"I won a match, I must be going up in rank\" but no. That's not how it works. You can win 7 matches in a row and when the game decides to update your rank, you'll find yourself in a lower division. The opposite can happen too. You can lose all of your matches and somehow move up. And your placement matches mean nothing. It doesn't matter how high you were in OW1 or how well you performed in your placements. Most players end up somewhere between silver-gold and will have to work their way up to their proper rank. This issue is made even worse by the fact that OW2 is F2P. Now there's an endless stream of smurfs and hackers in the lower divisions. If you're the type to solo-queue, you're going to have to claw your way tooth and nail through teammates below your skill level, GM smurfs, and aimbotters. \n\nI've never felt so betrayed by a game company before. I've dedicated years of my life to this IP. And what do I get in return? Empty promises and a slap to the face by greedy suits that don't care nor respect the players. They ruined a beloved IP with so much potential just for some quick profit. \n\nNow the only thing Overwatch is good for is being source material for r34 artists and animators.\n\nFuck Bobby Kotick and fuck Blizzard.",
