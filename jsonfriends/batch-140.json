        "review": "Esta gente cree que sacando su porquería de juego en Steam nosotros vamos olvidar que se rieron de nosotros en nuestra cara. 3 años estuve esperando su basura de PvE, tolerando que mataran Overwatch 1 bajo la excusa de que estaban poniendo todo su empeño en crear un digno sucesor de uno de los mejores juegos que han sacado, solo para que cancelaran todo y lo mandaran al carajo. \n\nCreen que sacando su juego aquí los vamos a perdonar o algo, cuando lo único que llevan haciendo desde el día 1 en que pusieron esta cosa en línea es reírse de nosotros, sus consumidores. En todos los aspectos, salvo el de la cantidad de personajes, este juego es objetivamente peor que su precuela. Sin embargo, claro que para los que disfrutamos en su día el juego original nos tenemos que comer este bodrio porque es todo lo que tenemos. Este NO ES UN JUEGO es una TIENDA CON EXCUSA DE PVP 5V5. Tiene el sistema de monetización más horrendo jamás creado, con skins vendidas a sobreprecio. Incluso las del juego anterior, que te las cobran como si fueran nuevas. Que alguien me explique QUE TAN MAL HAY QUE ESTAR EN ESTA VIDA PARA QUE LAS LOOTBOXES SEAN UN MEJOR SISTEMA QUE EL DE ESTE JUEGO.\n\n¿Te gusta Overwatch?, ¿te gusta el carisma de sus personajes?, ¿te gusta lo caótico de las partidas?, pues adelante, porque eso es algo que personalmente me encanta y me seguirá encantando de Overwatch, y es el único motivo por el que lo continúo jugando, aunque su sistema de emparejamiento sea objetivamente una porquería.\n\nRecomendación: No le metas dinero a esta tienda con excusa de juego. Puedes conseguirte todo gratis con Microsoft Rewards. He tenido el gusto de comprarme todos los pases de batalla literalmente gratis, porque a Blizzard no le pienso dar ni un solo centavo hasta que aprendan que nosotros, sus jugadores, no somos estúpidos.",

Game was fun to play, polished with cool seasonal events,skins and frequently rewarded lootboxes for playing the game(which you could also buy with real money and felt mostly fair)\n\nRight now we have ugh... this.\nFirst major change was locking new heroes behind grindy battlepass, comp synergy and hero swapping are really important in Overwatch and this just hurts the competitive integrity. I'm a returning player so unlike my friends I didn't get to know the thrill of having to unlock nearly every character via some shitty quests.\n\nThe other change was removal of the lootboxes, which granted couldn't be that bad if they didn't make skins extremely overpriced and passive currency from quests so small that it takes months to get one legendary(in a game where you will most likely play few heroes mind you).\n\nPolish from the first game is also gone, it's just not the same quality it was before and it shows.\nLast of all the PVE aspect of the game got cancelled, the reason for making Overwatch 2 was just straight up removed. Blizzard lied and we're just left with awful monetisation. There's no tell what they will pull off next.\n\nCompetitive is ruined because of hero unlocks.\nWant a new skin? Either waste money or grind for months, game doesn't respect you.\nThere are obvious signs of greed that are really discouraging to put any hours into the game right now, I wouldn't recommend playing it to anyone.",

It's nice to see it on steam finally. \n\nI play a lot of tf2 so seeing it be on the same platform is kind of surreal still... But hopefully this will dampen the hostility between the 2 games audiences. \n\nBoth are flawed (Tf2 with it's lack of updates and outdated source junk, and overwatch being associated with blizzard and having it's development team constantly making questionable decisions about everything related to their game), but both are still amazing games to have around. If you like shooters or are just a casual gamer, they can both offer unique experiences. One doesn't have to be better than the other.\n\nBut with all that being said, I still give it a 1/10 because they didn't make every character just a different version of Lúcio yet, so yeah that stinks.

        "review": "When Jeff Kaplan designed Winston in his laboratory, he was so full of life and happiness. He would barely be containing his excitement reading patch notes or new character ideas to us. One day, they bring Jeff into a large office and sit him down to talk about the future of Overwatch.  First maybe he thinks they are joking, playing a hilarious prank on their beloved Jeff, but after seeing the look in their eyes he goes through every stage of grief. When Jeff finally leaves the office after hours of pleading, he must return home, all hope crushed. That night, Jeff weeps. He weeps not only for his beloved child Winston, but for all of us as well. \n\nOverwatch 2 is a \"\"\"\"\"free\"\"\"\"\"game with smooth gameplay and great visuals. However, they use that and a sunk cost fallacy into making you think you are having fun. \"Oh I play a lot, I may as well buy the battle pass.\" \"Oh I play this character a lot, 1 skin won't hurt.\" When you compare this to Overwatch 1 it puts things in perspective. Buying 2 skins is just about the cost of OW1. Maybe if they didn't try to fool us it would sit better but they act like they are doing us a favor by making it a free game when in reality it just opens them up to be more predatory. If you are truly someone who can JUST play a game for the gameplay with no want for cosmetics, maybe you would enjoy overwatch 2. For people like me, the best part of Overwatch was logging in to see what new skins came with the holiday event, getting ready to earn some loot boxes with the boys while we try to get our skins, and playing on some cozy holiday renditions of maps. But now, the option isn't there. You can't go back to play OW1, you can't get free holiday skins so logging in to look at the new $20 skins we can't afford got old maybe the first 2 events. None of my friends who also loved OW1 can stomach this shit anymore. Even with 1000+ hours of sunk cost fallacy and loving OW1, I can't justify even having it downloaded. \nOh yeah, and you have to pay for the heroes so it really isn't even free.\n\nIn the old cutscene on startup, Winston would say \"They tore our family apart\" little did we know he could see the future",

        "review": "I have been playing OW for 6 years with over 2500h in the game. I was never the best of players, nor the worst. I have spent a decent amount of money on skins from OWL or specials, gathered a lot of them over the years. When OW2 was announced, I immediately bought the Watchpoint pack, then I loaded up on 3k OW coins I was planning to use for future Battlepasses. \nWhilst occasionally I have been toxic in game, my last ban was over 10 months ago for one month. I was excited for Invasion launch yesterday only to find out my 6 year old account with all my skins and coins balance was banned with no warning, with Bliz effectively stealing the money I have in my account. If you have had any experience with them, you would know they do not accept appeals as if they are Gods and they never make any error in their decisions. Anyways, they stole all this content, my account and my in game currency from me. \n\nSince I still somewhat enjoy their game, I made a new account and went on to purchase the newly released 15 euro Invasion DLC, which should include 1 battlepass season and the PVE content. I pay again, go on to download it, it is missing. You pay them for content, it is not there. There is no option to ask Steam for refund, because it is non-refundable. So effectively, I am out of pocket and Bliz stole my money again. \n\nPerhaps in due time I will manage to retrieve some of my money and content I was supposed to be enjoying while spending my hard-earned cash in this game. \n\nHowever, I will let you be the judge of whether this is how things are supposed to work with these people and what kind of company are we dealing with here. It is up to you where to give them a penny when you might end up like me in the end.",

Почему же я играю эту жалкую копию tf2? Все очень просто - Вдова и Эш... Как истинный милф хантер скажу что это наверно одни из самых красивых женский персонажей которые реально требуют скилла, ни в одной онлайн игре не получу такое удавольствие как этой недо-игре, когда эш бросает гранату и говорит Ayy! Catch! Или когда Вдова начинает ебашить на французком языке - реально приятно слушать, оружие вдовы пофиксили так что она не каждого ваншотит в голову, у эш ульта не накапливаеться когда она выпустила боба на поле боя - но даже это не ламает данных персонажей, никто не скажет что они имба. (Насчет Люцио - его бегание по стенах это кайф, челик крутит музыку на Spotify - и меняет хилл на спиды, паркур вообще топ) (Японские фразы Генджи, Кирико, Ханзо и т.д. - они топ (если у вас английская версия игры).\n(Everything for mommy) Моя оценка - 7/10.",

        "review": "I first played Overwatch during the Open Beta in 2016.\nI loved it. As a fan of Team Fortress 2, I felt comfy here too.\nWhen the game released, I played a lot of it, maybe around 300-400 hours? I have a lot of very good memories of this time. Hanzo's OP scatter arrows, 5 hero revives with Mercy, Roadhog's multimap long hook.\nFor the first year or two of the game, there were a lot of exciting updates.\nA PVE mode at Halloween, Lucioball during summer, etc.\nThis extra content was really enjoyable.\n\nAfter this, updates got a bit less exciting. No new modes, less new maps. Features like the Hero Limit were understandable, but I still didn't really like it, at least not for Quick Play. Role Queue was also introduced, and whilst I get the idea, this made matches a lot less exciting for me. Instead of the chaotic matches, matches started feeling extremely similar. For Competitive, it was more acceptable for me? I kind of liked how each Hero Category had their own Rank, because I certainly am better which some Categories (mainly support) than others.\n\nSome features were added later on that I still liked, like the group search, or grouping after the game, endorsements. New arcade modes were sometimes added, and later Custom Games, which I had hoped would have featured community game modes in the arcade, but I don't really think that happened. You could do Skirmishes or Custom Games or Training whilst Queueing, that was good. I think there was also rewards for reporting and having results from that action, which is great because whilst I had a lot of fun with the game, the game's chat was pretty much exclusively harassment. That's always been true for this game for me, which is a shame because I want to play and have fun, not play and be insulted.\n\nOverwatch 2 announced. Its free for PVP, and paid for PVE. Weird that it can not be Overwatch 1, but I liked some of the PVE events - like the Anniversery/Archives event, And PVP being free would mean more players.\n\nThe Overwatch 2 beta is released I play it. Wow, it is like Overwatch but with a ton of features I liked removed, and a ton of features I dislike added. Overwatch 2 releases. Overwatch 1 is kill. No more lootboxes, sounds good, in theory I am not a fan of them. Battle Passes, oh, I really dislike these. With lootboxes, there isn't much fear of missing out, you can reasonably get several a week, and they always give you something, and it is nothing related to gameplay. With the Battle Pass, there is fear of missing out, it takes so so so so much effort for anything - easily 10x if not 100x more than Overwatch 1, and some ARE related to gameplay, like characters.\nWhat about 5v5? Well, less shield spam I guess. But now I feel lonely as the Tank, and I feel so much more responsible and important, that isn't fun to me. I want to side kick with someone. I much preferred 6v6, hell, I'd take 7v7 or 8v8, that would be fun to me! Characters I used to like got big reworks with 5v5 in mind, and I don't really like the changes. I liked Orisa a lot in Overwatch 1, not so much in 2.\nWhat about that PVE? Well, after several years, with many features removed, I think its here? I'm not too interested with playing it.\nMy coins I saved up from Overwatch 1, gone, I can't remember what I got for them, Overwatch 2's beta was a long time ago.\nEndorsements, there are less of them, I prefered more.\nSearching for groups seem to be gone.\nNo cards at the end of games, they really made me feel special, or made me impressed with someone else, it was a nice bonus.\nI'm not sure if levels are still a thing, but I liked seeing how much experience I had, comparing to others. I wanted to get a Silver border, I don't think I was too far off.\nThere are now timed challenges, whilst I like challenges, I am not a fan of them being timed as that is a fear of missing out tactic. Whilst Overwatch 1 kind of had these with Events, or the weekly lootboxes, they weren't nearly as bad as now.\nThere are a bunch of new things that I don't really understand yet, like you can level up each hero category? I guess that encourages playing as them all?\nThere is a lot more diversity now, which is great, because I feel a lot more comfortable and appreciated. I understand a lot of people don't like diversity, they rarely feel unsafe or unrepresented or whatever, but it is very important for me. Specifically, I like seeing other player's who are queer like me. I feel happier around them. In Overwatch 1 the group search was useful for grouping with people who I could have fun with instead of being yelled at with, but that isn't here.\nOh I forgot, I believe an entire gamemode was removed from Overwatch 2, alongside all of its maps. I don't think it is possible to see Hanamura, Temple of Anubis, hell even the Moon Base Alpha or whatever it is called. I liked those maps and that gamemode.\nQueuing for matches seems to take a lot longer now. I am not sure if that was just when Hero Queue was added in Overwatch 1, or there are less players, or because Quick Play now has skill based match making instead of random (maybe that was always the case? I am not a fan of skill based match making quick play, as Competitive exists for that, and sometimes I want to goof around).\nI'm sure there are more things I am forgetting, but I think I have said most the things I found important about the original game.\n\nI might be wrong about some information I said, due to my inexperience with Overwatch 2, but it makes it hard for me to want to play to see what has remained in this hollow shell of a game I used to love. Sure, a lot of aspects are the same, but altogether it is just a lesser version, at least for me.\nI want to recommend this game, but I can't, I would just be recommending the memories I had of the first game, specifically earlier versions of the first game. I really miss that.\nIt seems like a bunch of tiny changes made, like the main game is still there, but it feels so much worse to play. I can't emphasise how important those tiny changes are altogether.\n",
