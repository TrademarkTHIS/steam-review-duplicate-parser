        "review": "I have around 20-30 hours on my battle.net account for this game and ive been preparing a full review since it was announced to release on steam. This has to be one of the most lazy uninteresting and boring sequels of the past 10 years. \nThis game has 3 big problems\n\n1) The game itself\n\n2) The store and battlepass\n\n3) The sequel part of it\n\n1. I don’t know how or why but this game is so boring for no reason. Without friends its draining to play through, even with them it’s a gamble if youll be able to have fun because of the pretty bad matchmaking. Youd get put into a match where the enemy team seem to have over at least 300 hours on it completely destroying your team in the matter of sometimes minutes. This has happened MANY times to me alone and with friends. The heroes are boring and really average. Their personality is nothing but how they are played. Mercy? Character who is designed like an angel and wants to help people. Reaper? Dark costume evil mask and talks about killing. Junkrat? Crazy guy who does crazy stuff. And if you didn’t buy 60 bones on overwatch 1 youll have to earn ALL heroes one by one unless you ofcourse.. want to spend money on it! I have almost 30 hours on this game and im yet to unlock all of them.\n\n2. The battlepass has to be one of the worst in any game I have ever played. Its so average. The only excuse of this existing is the fact that the game is free but youll have to pay up if youd want the new character as fast as possible. The store is no different, found a reaper bundle that had like 3 skins 1 icon like 1 voice lines and 1 victory pose for 25-30 DOLLARS, that is an INSANE price tag for 1 jpeg 2 extra stuff and 3 skins. \n\n3. This is not a sequel, this is a watered down version of the first game made to appeal with the modern gaming market. Nothing else. Filled with battlepasses, overpriced bundles etc. Don’t even get me started on the whole PvE and skill tree that was MARKETED for the game since its announcement even after its release to then be canceled 8 months into the games life. And now they want people to pay 15 bucks for a 3 mission pack of the unfinished feature that will most likely take like an hour or so to beat. This is beyond scummy.\nOverall while the game isn’t glichy or unfinished its sloppy with its gameplay, balancing, matchmaking, marketing etc with overpriced bundles a bad battlepass boring gameplay all covered up with its free price tag. A useless stain on not only Overwatch and Activison (like they don’t already have a massive stain on them). If you want to play another hero shooter there are some on steam rn. This is not worth your time. Thanks for reading :3",

But 10 months later, this game still seems to be broken and unappealing for anything more serious than a few matches a month.\n- the matchmaking seems to be broken since the release\n- the most interesting part of overwatch (its original characters) is being completely neglected\n- skins are too expensive (especially for a game where you dont even see the skin when playing)\n- new gamemode push is horrendous and you cant even choose gamemodes/maps you want to play so getting push as your first game ruins your session and you close the game instead\n- changing from 2 tanks to 1 gigatank makes it too reliant on the tank player you get -> team with better tank player usually wins the game\n- many smaller changes that are straight up downgrade from ow1 (no time to chat with other team at the end the game just kicks you out, no real progression except for payed battlepass, no earning skins thru playing, paywalled mid PVE 15€ for 1,5 hour gameplay?, etc... )\n\nAlso if you know anything about Blizz you basically cannot play this game without feelings of guilt for \"supporting\" such a rotten company.",

The skins are now $20 (but force you to buy them from a $25 bundle) and are significantly less detailed than what was free in ow1. PREDATORY MONETIZATION AT ITS FINEST.\n\nIt's obvious the devs don't even play the game because the balance changes they do make no godamn sense while they ignore what people actually complain about.\n\nThey also lied to us for years about what pvp would be.",

First they said they would improvement the graphics from the first game but are barely noticeable, making me question whether any real effort was put into enhancing the visual experience.\nThe micro transactions are awful. You know it's sad when players want loot boxes back. They now put everything behind a paywall, preying on players' desire to customize their heroes with enticing skins and emotes. It's sad to see a game that was once praised for its fair and reasonable approach to in-game purchases succumb to the same predatory practices that have become all too common in the gaming industry.\n\nFurthermore, the lack of a compelling single-player campaign is a glaring problem. Overwatch 2's story mode feels like an afterthought, The absence of a strong single-player experience is a missed opportunity to provide a well-rounded gaming package for those who might not be as interested in competitive multiplayer.\n It's also disappointing that you have to pay $15 dollars for these half baked story missions they hyped people up for only for it to be stuck behind a paywall.\n\nOver all Overwatch 2 is a bitter disappointment that fails to capture the magic of its predecessor. It's a mishmash of questionable design choices, lackluster visuals, and a dearth of meaningful content. If you're a fan of the original Overwatch, I'd recommend tempering your expectations before diving into this lackluster sequel.",

It doesn't matter how much the Activision has tried to fuck up this game.\n\nThe game at it's essence is just insanely well made and if anything the Overwatch 2 devs have taken the game in a much better direction. Overwatch 1 had a complete misunderstanding of what mechanics were actually FUN, meanwhile Overwatch 2 has taken the game in a direction which allows for much more individual skill expression which for the majority of players results in a much more enjoyable experience. The game actually feels like a SHOOTER and each individual player has much more agency. On top of it, Overwatch has always and keeps having some of the most polish of any shooter out there.\n\nI feel bad for many of the developers because it's not their fault that the full-scale PVE was cancelled or that microtransactions are overpriced. It's completely due to mismanagement for the higher ups. It's sad because a lot of the changes are clear improvements. But, Activision Blizzard simply do not know how to do business and due to that all of those devs' time, effort and love has been spent on a game that people will hate for things external to the core game itself.

        "review": "this title really was simply kicked in the nuts by blizzard, holy cow. i'll just mention what i know:\n\n-the long anticipated PvE mode with hero skill trees and high replayability was essentially cancelled, even though that was the reason why overwatch 2 happened in the first place. nice. what was happening for the last 4 years?\n-most heroes are now locked by default and need to either be level-grinded or purchased, which limits team composition options in a game centered around team composition.\n-the reward system is much worse than before; the battle pass essentially requires players to spend $10, then play the game crack-addict style in order to earn hero-specific items (for heroes that you might not even play) that are set in stone for an entire 9 weeks, which is a real gut punch for casual players. the loot box system, while still being what it was, was much more fun and rewarding.\n-the pricing is non-intuitive and generally greedy; on top of the fact that item bundles are around $20 or more, if you only want to purchase one of the items included in a bundle, sorry, you still need to pay for the full bundle. (yikes!) at the very least the pricing of items has been improved as they used to be much worse on release. (ex. $20 for one legendary skin on release) however, i still wouldn't call the price reduction a forgiving change because of everything else they've done to this game.\n-cosmetic features and other details were neutered; player portraits and a bunch of other features (ex. the \"on-fire\" system) that satisfied players, encouraged player progression, and gave overwatch its identity were affected in some way or removed for pretty much no reason.\n-this isn't a fault of overwatch 2 specifically, but in general, the game has become very centered around the competitive aspects, which led to the traditional influx of online toxicity, which again, is a real gut punch towards casual players since you end up being yelled at by your teammates in almost every match you're in.\n-also, i'm sorry, but mccree's rename was genuinely stupid. i don't have any form of rebuttal for this... *WHY* would you make one of your most popular characters sound like a macaroni mascot?!?\n\ni loved the original overwatch. :(",

Blizzard scrapped Overwatch 1, completely functional game, for this game with promises that it would be a fun PvE shooter. But after realizing how much money they made with this cash grab, they dropped PvE completely so that they can push more battlepasses down our throats. Now, new characters are under a pay wall (they were free in OW1) and skin bundles cost as much as the original Overwatch. Seriously, if you are new and wanted to try this game out, go ahead if you are ready to drop some more dollars onto this game. Otherwise, just play Team Fortress 2 instead. That game is actually completely free, arguably more fun than OW2 and isn't developed by a trashy company.",

Все это долбится в арке до дыма. Потом снимается с пейлоада и остужается в Вьюге. Потом Аарон Келлер заносит и щедро прогрев гоев начинает добавлять контент. При этом закидывает скины по 20 евро. Закидывает и приговаривает полушепотом ух бля. При этом у него на лбу аж пот выступает. Любезно мне иногда предлагает, но я отказываюсь. Надо ли говорить о том какой дичайший баттлпасс потом?

After that it went downhill with design choices, queerbait and a vast increase in dubious monetarisation. \nOverwatch® 2 topped it all with the lies about a supposedly free PVE expansion that never came, or well now that it has it costs you money, duh. I particularly enjoyed the bluntest and most shameless survey about what people would be willing to pay for certain types of cosmetics shortly before Overwatch® 2 was announced (which of you said 20 bucks for a damn skin would be okay? lol). \nSo yeah now we have a game that is trying to sell itself as what it used to be at launch (TF2 but with boobies). When in reality its just another battle past wage slave game where you have nothing to gain aside from a negative credit rating. \nIf you want a comp experience just play LoL, if you want the porn go to certain patreons and subreddits, if you want the team shooter experience (which I doubt if you play Overwatch® 2) play TF2. I don't know what you should play if you want the PVE experience since Overwatch® PVE was never special and most people I know just did it for those sweet sweet omnic sprays. Maybe Destiny Warframe? Lost Arc or WoW? Depends on what you want I guess.",
