        "review": "Overwatch 2: Because One Heroic Fiasco Wasn't Enough\"\n\nWell, well, well, Overwatch is back, and this time they've doubled down on the chaos and confusion with Overwatch 2. Because apparently, saving the world once just wasn't challenging or ridiculous enough. If you thought the original Overwatch was a symphony of absurdity, get ready for a sequel that's more like a cacophony of \"Wait, what just happened?\"\n\nLet's start with the graphics. The heroes now look so detailed that you can count the pixels in Hanzo's scowl as he tries to hit a target smaller than his ego. The level of realism is truly breathtaking, especially when Reaper dramatically throws his guns on the ground like a petulant teenager who just lost a Fortnite match.\n\nBut don't worry, the hero designs are still as sensible as ever. We've got heroes with hair so gravity-defying that I'm convinced Winston's been secretly selling them anti-gravity hair gel. And let's not forget the armor. I mean, who needs practical armor when you can strut into battle wearing a feather boa and call it a \"tactical advantage\"?\n\nGame modes? Oh boy, they've outdone themselves. Push mode is like trying to coordinate a team of caffeinated squirrels, all hopped up on energy drinks and sugar. And the new \"Escort the Payload While Juggling Watermelons\" mode is a masterpiece of confusion, leading you to question whether you're playing a shooter or auditioning for a circus act.\n\nNow, the PvE story mode is where things get truly \"insightful.\" It's like the writers gathered in a room, threw darts at a board covered in random story clichés, and decided to run with whatever stuck. I mean, who could forget the heartwarming moment when Winston and Roadhog bonded over their mutual love of ham sandwiches? Truly Shakespearean.\n\nAnd don't even get me started on the voice lines. From Tracer's unforgettable proclamation, \"Cheers, love! The cavalry's here!\" to Genji's deep philosophical question, \"If a ninja falls in a forest and no one's around to hear it, does he make a sound?\"—the voice lines are a testament to the poetic genius of Overwatch's writing team.\n\nIn conclusion, Overwatch 2 is a masterclass in how to take a perfectly functional game, crank up the insanity dial to eleven, and then stand back to watch the fireworks of confusion explode. If you're looking for a game that'll have you questioning your life choices and the very fabric of reality, look no further. Overwatch 2: Because sometimes, more is definitely not better.\n\nRating: 2/5 \"Eye-Rolling Emotes\" – It's a sequel that manages to outdo itself in the most bewildering and eyebrow-raising ways possible.",

The game truly is on its downfall, so I say just enjoy it while it is still up :).\n\nThe game is damn good and I do believe it is better than TF2 (sorry for being unbased!!). But this is what happens when you promise the world and then deliver... well I would have used a fancy expression, but they truly delivered nothing.\n\nAll I can say is: have fun while you still can, you better believe I will be doing this instead of dooming about the inevitable.\n\nPS: From personal experience ranging all the way back from my Fortnite days, do not give money for microtrasnactions, PLEASE. You have no idea how stress free my life has been without spending anything. Please just go out and play some snooker or visit a public pool with the money instead.",

        "review": "Overwatch é um jogo memorável pra mim, jogo desde do seu lançamento e fiz muitas amizades, joguei com pessoas que já conhecia de longa data, tive momentos felizes nesse jogo, muito mesmo e sinto falta desses momentos. \nSempre achei um jogo com um potencial enorme, a arte desse jogo, os personagens são cativantes, possuem personalidade forte e cada um tem sua marca, é um jogo que possui uma diversidade imensa, tem uma preocupação com a origem dos personagens, com sua história, com seu desenvolvimento, enfim, em questão de arte o jogo é impecável, é de fato, uma obra de arte (me desculpem o trocadilho) \n\nEntretanto eu lamento sempre que vejo overwatch por ai, ou sempre que logo nesse jogo o fato dele ser da blizzard, é como se você tivesse pintado uma linda obra de arte e deixasse ela jogada em um canto, desbotando, sem nunca retoca-la ou emoldura-la e ela com o tempo vai perdendo seu contraste, sua originalidade, sua potência de obra de arte. \n\nInfelizmente overwatch sempre foi muito injustiçado pela blizzard, é um jogo que você nota por parte da direção de arte que teve um carinho, uma dedicação e um apreço, mas do que adianta se a empresa não sabe explorar o verdadeiro potencial desse jogo? \n\nEu lamento muito, muito mesmo. Foram anos de um jogo largado, com uma equipe de balanceamento fazendo reworks o tempo todo em personagens e mudando muitas características deles ingame a ponto de ficar enjoativo, você não sabia qual seria o próximo rework, só a symmetra por exemplo já passou por 10000 reworks, doomfist, torbjorn, cassidy (finado mccree) entre muitos outros. A equipe de balanceamento é simplesmente amadora e parece que não joga o próprio game. \n\nOutra coisa ruim é que a blizzard é muito predatória e monetiza de um jeito totalmente abusivo, com preços inflacionados de tal forma que se você tiver pelo menos um pingo de noção, você não gasta um real nesse jogo. São preços fora da realidade econômica do nosso país e jogos concorrentes tem preços muito mais acessíveis o que inviabiliza qualquer investimento no jogo, pelo menos antigamente quando o jogo era pago a gente tinha ainda formas mais fáceis de grindar e conseguir a skin tanto desejada, através de acúmulo de moedas ou tirando a própria skin mesmo. Agora o grind é simplesmente muito mais absurdo e sendo bem honesto? não vale a pena fazer um trilhão de desafios pra conseguir uma skin ou pagar caro nisso. Quem pagou pelo overwatch 1 recebeu umas coisas ridículas e tão somente isso, não teve nenhum benefício real, não teve nada de interessante de fato pra quem pagou pelo jogo, ainda tem que pagar mais e mais se você quiser ter algo por lá. \n\nEnfim, se eu fosse escrever sobre como a blizzard é péssima administrando esse jogo eu passaria mais de um dia escrevendo aqui. É realmente uma pena ver que esse jogo foi concebido pela blizzard e eu fico extremamente triste pela direção de arte desse jogo, se eu fizesse parte dessa equipe e visse o estado que esse jogo esteve/está e pelo visto estará atualmente eu entraria em uma depressão profunda. \n\nEnfim, lindo jogo, ótimos personagens, com um enredo incrível e só. A blizzard jogou esse jogo pro alto e constantemente desrespeita quem o joga com falsas promessas, monetização abusiva, balanceamento porco, ranked sem nenhum prêmio que realmente valha a pena, um cenário morto e afundado e outros 3439483 problemas\n\nSe for jogar, jogue pelos personagens, são legais. Mas tenha em mente tudo isso. \nBlizzard simplesmente é um grande exemplo de uma empresa q não merece um centavo. \n",

The balance is an endless rabbit hole that I won't even bother explaining with anything other than \"It's dogshit\". \nThough I love the art style, characters have so many flashy abilities that, in less than 5 minutes in-game, my screen is a visual clusterfuck, where I don't even know what the fuck is going on. What dealt so much damage to me? Why couldn't I kill an enemy that I was shooting for 10 seconds straight? and ultimately, what the fuck even killed me?\nCosmetics are either ugly as shit or sick as fuck, there is no in-between, but both have one thing in common and that's that they are overpriced as all hell. Microtransactions in this game are ass, even the Battlepass that takes a million years to level up.\nDon't bother with this game.",
