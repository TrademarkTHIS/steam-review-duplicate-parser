Ayrıca 2 dediğime de bakmayın, bildiğin 1 bu.[/h1]\n\n[b]Oyunun İtibarı[/b]\nİlk oyundan ayrı en, ve tek, belirgin özelliği 6v6 formatını 5v5’e indirmeleri. Fikir güzel fakat bu bile “Yeni bir oyun çıkarıyoruz!” imajına yetmiyor. Bunu kendileri de bildikleri için birkaç özellikle daha geleceğini duyuruyorlar. Bunlardan biri de PvE sistemi. Yakın zamanda iptal ettiklerini belirtmişlerdi fakat gelen negatif tepkilerden dolayı acınası bir girişimde bulunup yakın zamanda oyuna geleceğini tekrar duyurdular. Şaka gibi fakat bunu da paket halinde satıyorlar. Oyunun Steam gibi farklı bir platformda da çıkması, oyuncu sayısının ne kadar azaldığını gözler önüne seriyor.\n\n[b]Battlepass Sistemi[/b]\nHer heronun bir counterı var fakat yeni bir hesapta heroların bir kısmı kapalı oluyor. İsterseniz 30 küsür saat oynayarak bütün hepsini açabilirsiniz, isterseniz de battlepass ile kendilerine anında sahip olabilirsiniz. Amaçları oldukça belli. Ayrıca eski oyunda seviye başına kutu alırken artık haftalık görevlerle dilencilere bırakılmayacak paraları ödül olarak veriyorlar. Sözde oynarak da kazanabileceğiniz bir sistem bu fakat yanlış anlaşılmasın, bu şekilde beğendiğiniz bir skini açmak bile haftalarınızı alacak.\n\n[b]Sonuç[/b]\nBlizzard’ın son zamanlarda verdiği mantıklı karar sayısı yok denecek kadar az. İlk çıktığı yıllarda severek oynadığım oyunun şu an bu hallere düşmesi tamamen Activision Blizzard’ın para sevdasının sonucu. Hiçbir kral sonsuza kadar başta kalamıyor maalesef.",

        "review": "Bit of a disclaimer: I have not played Overwatch 1 but I have over 300 hours in Overwatch 2\n\n1. When I had initially started playing on launch I immediately noticed that the balance felt off among some of the characters in-game. I eventually found out not long after that the game was originally structured with a 6v6 format and even after all the changes and transforming the game into a 5v5 shooter it still feels like a sizable portion of characters were made for 6v6 with examples being D.va, Wrecking Ball, Orisa, etc. \n\n2. The micro transactions are absolutely absurd and the cost of some of the skins and bundles are close to the price of whole day 1 AAA releases (Junkbot and Roadbot bundle around the time it came out).\n\n3. Matchmaking has always felt off, and more so if you you tend to do a lot of solo queue. Your experience will generally be getting stomped or being the one doing the stomping which is often times more frustrating than fun. Very rarely have I run into hard fought matches that genuinely feel like everyone was on the same skill level.\n\n4. The game is nearly borderline pay to win. You can still earn new characters via the battlepass, but you don't get access to them until you're halfway through while people who bought the battlepass get access to them on release. Keep in mind that most of the new characters that have been introduced have significantly shifted the meta with them being top tier picks on release like Kiriko and Rammatra with Wifeleaver being the exception so far that i'm aware of. I haven't played Illari so idk how she fits into the meta. \n\n5. Finally, the reason the game is called Overwatch 2, the PVE. The invasion update is what most people in the community have been waiting for, and why Overwatch 1 saw a lack of content for a while prior to 2020 as far as I'm aware. The invasion content is priced around 15 dollars for what is pretty much 1-3 hours of story content. That's it. Overwatch 1 came to a halt for this PVE content only for Blizzard to drip feed that content in 15 dollar passes per season update. That being said I wouldn't blame the devs for this, this is purely a bad management issue coupled with corporate greed. So with their original plans of PVE officially scrapped, the only changes that warranted the 2 in Overwatch 2 were shop updates and a battlepass with a shift to being free to play.\n\nThe Verdict: If you're a masochist then this is the game for you. If not then honestly you should save some money up for a product that is actually worth your time like Baldur's Gate 3 or BattleBit Remastered.\n\n",

Purchases dont show up, but atleast they dropped the hero bundle price and the stupid phone number requirements on new accounts.\n\nReturning player and I already regret this choice. Had to update because it is now a day past the release and this *small* bug hasent been fixed.  Any smaller, lesser known game, would already have 1000 videos outright calling it what it is, a fucking scam.\n\n\n\nUnlocking hero's through gameplay is not a satisfying feeling when you FUCKING PAID FOR THEM.  Bobby Kotick needs to pull the dick out his ass and do his fucking job already.",

        "review": "[h1]Overwatch 2 has no respect for you, it's an attempt to pry open your wallet while masquerading as the game it used to be.[/h1]\n\nI picked up the game in 2016 and was instantly hooked like so many others. Overwatch remained my favourite shooter for years - even during the draught of content on the run up to OW2.\n\nWhile it retains its charming design, wonderful cast of characters and some of the best multiplayer maps I've ever played on, OW2 brought a few enormous fundamental downgrades that leave it critically flawed. Let me explain;\n\n[b]#1 - Heroes in battlepass[/b]\n\nThe biggest change, this alone put all the nails in the coffin.\n\nOverwatch is a game based around hero picks and team synergy. Every single character brings unique advantages, pairing well with some and poorly with others. Overwatch used to have a few heroes introduced every year completely free for everyone to play. Overwatch 2 now expects you to either grind to unlock new characters, or pony up cash for the Battlepass to play them on release (or £9 each for old characters).\n\nThis doesn't sound game breaking at a first glance, but now consider the fact you can queue into competitive games without the full roster of characters.\n\nThis is a core gameplay feature, in a competitive game, behind a paywall.\n\nHow can there be fair competition if one team has more options than the other? And purely because they paid for it? Sounds a bit like pay to win, but I'll let you decide for yourself.\n\n[b]#2 - The battlepass itself, and the new approach to cosmetics[/b]\n\nI've never really been opposed to the idea of battlepass systems, but compared to other games OW2's passes are a joke. Each pass has 80 levels of stuff, usually 8 skins (with a very nice customisable one at the end) and a bunch of other stuff to pad it out - as is the norm. This filler stuff ranges from titles and nameplates to emotes. I believe they've recently added credits in there, which is a great step forward, but doesn't undo the aforementioned critical misstep of including core gameplay features behind a paywall.\n\nCosmetics have always been a huge part of Overwatch, the skins are designed by insanely talented artists with equally talented modellers. These skins continue to be fantastic, but the prices are insulting. Legendary skins (ones that aren't just recolours) are on average around £20+ each.\n\nThese used to be obtained via lootboxes, you'd get one every level up which tends to be insanely frequent. In my time playing I only bought boxes on a few occasions and still managed to get most skins for most characters. Most people's argument for them bringing in the store was that the generous lootbox system was losing them money - this is simply wrong. In 2019 (3 years after launch) Overwatch had already made $1billion via lootboxes.\n\nThere's now essentially no free way to get skins, unless you want to grind challenges for months on end for a single legendary.\n\n[b]#3 - The PvE[/b]\n\nI never had too much interest in the PvE - but it was the driving point behind the whole idea of Overwatch 2.\n\nThat's what we were told anyway, it ended up just being a bait and switch to implement all these new monetisation systems. Hell, even after the \"cancellation\" of PvE we're still getting PvE missions? Except they're now being sold as individual packs, just another way to squeeze your wallet.\n\nIn Summary\n\nIf you like competitive shooters - Overwatch 2 has no competitive integrity.\n\nIf you like collecting cosmetics - Overwatch 2 expects you to hand over your entire wallet\n\nThe game is fun, I still feel the experience I love so much in there, it's just damaged by such intrusive greed I can't recommend it to anyone.",

And we waited for nothing. 4 years for 2 heroes and 3 new maps + 1 new gamemode. While they removed 3 maps and another game mode. So in total, 3 new heroes.\n    [*]The change to 5v5 from 6v6 never worked at any point. All the character kits are designed with 6v6 in mind so that nothing fits currently even after a year of OW2. And they won’t be fixing it without either reverting to 6v6 or revamping all characters, which neither will happen\n    [*]Battle pass\n[/list]\n\nThere are so many other issues with this game and company but I just can't anymore.

        "review": "Overwatch was an amazing game. I'm not a super competitive FPS player, but I enjoyed playing Quick Play and Arcade modes for years, even during the content drought as we waited for OW2.\n\nOW2 was originally meant to primarily be about the PvE. We were going to buy OW2 for a set price like most other Blizzard products and just own the game. The PvP side of OW2 was going to be \"free\" for OW1 players, but you weren't going to have to purchase OW2 to continue playing.\n\nYears after its reveal and some occasional updates, they pulled the rug out from under the Overwatch community. They announced it was going free to play. It wasn't going to work at all how they originally revealed it years before. PvE was going to be trickled out slowly even though it had already been delayed and was taking longer than expected. The PvP side came out first and the game went F2P. Previously all heroes were always available, but now you either had to buy the new battlepass to get the hero right away, or do a very slow grind to unlock it. This alone really ruins a major important aspect of the original game, that you always had access to the entire roster. That was a core principle of the game and the current model will always be a blasphemous replacement of a previously great system. \n\nThe new business model drove a lot of the original playerbase away. The move to Steam was a move of desperation trying to find new players to replace all those they cast out when they changed their business model. If you doubt this, consider that Blizzard has NEVER put a major current title on Steam before. Not because it would have been difficult to do so, but because they didn't want to share any of their income from the game with Valve. This was a last resort to try to recover from the massive fumble that OW2 has been.  \n\nWhat's worse is that they then announced they were canceling the largest part of PvE content that we had waited years for. No idea what they were even working on for all those years or where all that effort went, but they apparently just abandoned a lot of it. Now we're just getting a tiny trickle of story missions every season and none of the systems or mechanics they had previewed. Even more egregiously, they are still charging money for access to those story missions despite their swap to a F2P model. Even though most PvE content was canceled, they're still going to charge us money for a few missions at a time. You have to buy the battle pass to get \"permanent access\" to any of the new PvE content. While OW2 would have cost $40-60 for the entire game and all PvE content it would have gotten over time, you now have to pay $15 for 3 missions at a time per season. This means for what the price of OW2 should have been, you'll end up with maybe 12 story missions after 4 seasons and won't get any of the major PvE systems we had originally expected. They are so desperate to try to turn what are likely terrible numbers around that they are trying to use FOMO to actually make some money and show that their change of business model wasn't a complete and total failure. \n\nAlso important to note that OW2 is NOT a true sequel to OW1. It is at best a minor expansion pack and re-brand. It is the same game, the same updated client and the same player data (all your OW1 cosmetics and stats just continued over into OW2 and you just downloaded a patch when it was released). They called it OW2 because they had to call it a new game in order to betray all the original promises about how new heroes and maps were always going to be released in OW1. \n\nThe original OW1 team had a great vision and tried to have as ethical and decent a business model as a game run by a greedy for-profit corporation with Bobby Kotick at the helm could have. Loot boxes were cosmetic only and far less predatory than their current F2P business model. OW2 is a tragic downgrade from the original game and no longer run by people who really care about their players or seem to enjoy the game themselves. The only hope for this game's future is if Microsoft gets rid of the fools in any position of power that chose to cancel the bulk of PvE and made heroes a paid or slow unlock. The game needs better management and leadership to return to being an amazing IP.",

While the game functions perfectly fine, in-game purchases do NOT. Purchased the €15 Invasion Bundle and got nothing out of it.

They then proceed to replace the soul of Overwatch with pure corporate greed with the inclusion of an overpriced cash shop and crappy battle pass.\n\nUnfortunately, OW2 lacks substantial new content and instead presents downgrades and unfulfilled promises. We have lost features like the end-of-game cards, cool rank icons, portraits, fun progression unlocks for skins. Furthermore, the game is plagued with numerous bugs, with each patch introducing new game-breaking issues. Blizzard claims to fix the matchmaking regularly, but as a Diamond player, I have still been matched with top 100 players in Europe.\n\nDon't get me wrong, the new additions in Overwatch 2 are cool. I appreciate the introduction of new heroes, maps, and game modes. However, these features should not come at the cost of compromising the integrity of the game by removing progression systems and other game modes.\n\nI was genuinely excited about was the introduction of PvE game modes. The idea of levelling up heroes and battling robots across different locations in the world held great potential, especially considering Blizzard's expertise with games like WoW and Diablo.\n\nUnfortunately, they decided to cancel the primary selling point of the \"2\" and instead divide the remaining campaign content into a battle pass. This demonstrates a severe disconnect between the company and its fans. I urge anyone who shares this sentiment to refrain from supporting the game.\n\nRegrettably, there will always be naive players who continue to purchase $20 skins, enabling this exploitative practice to thrive. As long as this continues,  for me, there is no hope for the future of this franchise.",

Por una parte Overwatch me acompaño en momentos difíciles de mi vida y al cual le he dedicado miles de horas en Battlenet y por supuesto que tiene un lugar bien ganado en mi corazón, pero han sido años tras años de promesas incumplidas por parte de Blizzard, años en los cuales el videojuego estuvo sin recibir contenido con la excusa de que la segunda parte sería épica y llena de contenido y variedad para al final solo quedarse en lo mínimo, otra vez.\n\nAmo el Gameplay, se me hace satisfactorio su Game Feel, sus personajes me encantan, sus mapas coloridos y llenos de Lore y trasfondo me emocionan, pero después veo los precios abusivos de su tienda, lo que se tardan en balancear a los héroes, la mentira que fue el PvE, lo malo y repetitivos que son los eventos y el poco contenido que sacan cada season y cada cosita va sumando con el paso de los años que drenan de cierta manera el aprecio que uno siente hacía el juego.\n\nSi eres alguien nuevo que jamás jugó a Overwatch 1 en su momento, posiblemente te acabe gustando pero si eres como yo y otros miles de fans de esta franquicia que ya no nos conformamos con migajas, pues obviamente es un videojuego al cual no podemos recomendar. \n\nComo menciono en el titular, Overwatch es un gran videojuego pero lastimosamente es de Blizzard...",

Taking advantage of an uninformed consumerbase's good will.  [/h1]\n\nAlso, this game isn't even a sequel as it exists now. The circumstances and release of it's content is entirely a re-brand of the original Overwatch. Meaning it was a glorified update, akin to Fortnite Chapter (x). This comes with the added caveat of [i] replacing Overwatch 1 as you rememebr it. [/i]\n\nThey then \n[list]\n    [*]Timidly admitted during a stream that the actual PvE was canceled\n    [*]tried to sweep that under the rug\n    [*]and then just drop [b] \"PVE IT'S OVERWATCH PVE GUYS LOOK PVE HERE IT IS!!!!!\" [/b] ignoring and obscuring the fact that said PvE is merely consisted of all the bones and flesh of what was supposed to be a fully fledged PvE campaign with fun skill trees, new abilities, and L4D style co-op.\n[/list]\n\nSo uh\nFug :DDDDDDDDDDD this game!!!!!!!!!!!!\n\nAlso the balancing is shit. Bad game. Remove Role Queue and don't ever force esports again. [spoiler] (The pros only pick from a pool of 5 characters on a given patch and it's boring and shitty, Blizzard is forced to hotfix just to keep it interesting.) [/spoiler]\nAmong so many other minor issues I could gripe for eternity over.\n\n[b] DO NOT PLAY THIS GAME! YOUR TIME WILL BE WASTED! [/b]\nIf you want to play a Hero shooter with a lot of heroes and fun ways to play them, go stomach Paladins, or better yet, make a new one.\n\n*edit*\nI forgot since I bought the game ages ago, but another massive issue that makes the game actively shit is the BP motivated \"Hero Unlock\" crap.\nIn a game ORIGINALLY DESIGNED AROUND SWAP COUNTERING AND COMP EXPERIMENTATION????\nTheir alleged design philosophy has been to make heroes more versatile to counter this, but they're creating the problems themselves. Idk which came first, the rework of the unlocks possibly due to BP, or the wanting to overhaul the feel on a per character basis, but they don't even succeed at their design goals anyway like how they said they wanted healers to be more aggro, and then don't buff mercy's gun to compare with other healers, and nerf her movement.\n\nbad. shit, even.",

Balance seems to still be basically a myth maybe even a legend so yeah there is no balance. The game is still chaotic as fuck you still cant tell what really happens at any point in time. The new hero is really boring to play just a cookie cutter healer with a \"DPS\" ultimate.

        "review": "I'd like to say, it is a testament to how poorly this game is doing when they have chosen to bring this game to Steam, even knowing the reputation this game has on Steam, even outside of Steam for that matter. I feel not sympathy, but rather pure humor and joy that this game is being dog-pilled by reviews that can be shared and shown to all viewers on this platform. I hope for the continuous downfall of this game and that it never recovers.\n\nI've spent years coming back and leaving this game due to many faults that this game grew over the lifespan of OW1 and 2. With PVE basically being massacred and turned into a shell of what was promised, this game is worthless and bloated compared to 1. It does not respect your time, your money, your fun, or you as a person. The company uses excuses to cover up their laziness and inability to do anything outside of making a 20$ skin that looks like it was a common skin from OW1. \n\nDon't spend a second nor a dime on this game. The team that had a passion to make a fun, competitive, team shooter with abilities. That team is long gone. You will receive only deceptions, heartbreak, and a desire for something of actual quality. Go play Team Fortress 2, the game may only have 2 people working on it, but at least those two people enjoy the game they are making.\n\nTL;DR \nI hate this game and the company that owns the IP because they ruined it. Play something else.",

I dont recommend spending anything tho'.\n\nGreat F2P game with a team of friends, not a great product or really a great experience for people who want to invest time and effort into the game.",
