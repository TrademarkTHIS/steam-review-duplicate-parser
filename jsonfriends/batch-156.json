        "review": "Ugh, seriously? Overwatch 2? More like Overwatch Too-lame-to-be-true. I can't believe they're actually trying to milk this cash cow even further. I mean, come on, it's been how many years since the original Overwatch? And all they're giving us is some half-baked sequel that's more like an expansion pack than anything else.\n\nFirst of all, let's talk about the graphics. You'd think after waiting for ages, they'd at least step up their game in the visual department. But nope, it's like they're stuck in 2016. The so-called \"upgraded\" graphics look barely any different from the first game. Did they even try? I've seen indie games with better visuals at this point.\n\nAnd don't even get me started on the new heroes. It's like they're scraping the bottom of the creativity barrel. A robot hamster in a ball? Really? That's the best they could come up with? It's like they're trying to make memes into characters now. And don't even get me started on the whole \"hero missions\" thing. Like, who asked for that? We just want more actual gameplay modes, not some watered-down single-player experience.\n\nOh, and the worst part? The microtransactions and loot boxes are still front and center. It's like they learned absolutely nothing from the backlash they received for the first game's loot box system. They're still trying to nickel and dime us for skins and cosmetics, and it's just plain insulting.\n\nThe fact that they're marketing this as a whole new game is a slap in the face to the loyal fans who've been sticking around since day one. It's like they think we're all a bunch of idiots who will buy anything with the Overwatch name slapped on it. Well, guess what Blizzard, we're not that stupid.\n\nOverall, Overwatch 2 feels like a lazy attempt to milk more money out of a once-great franchise. The lack of innovation, recycled graphics, and the continued focus on microtransactions make it clear that they care more about our wallets than delivering a quality gaming experience. Save your money and stick with the original Overwatch – at least that one didn't try to pull the wool over our eyes with a half-hearted sequel.",

I have 290 hours with Bastion in total and I specialize in stickin' it straight up their fuckin' culo. Bastion is a way of life for me. Go in there, I bend em over, I open their cheeks nice and wide, I get a nice clear view of the colon, prostate, and the coccyx, and I knucklefuck em all the way up to the palm right up the buttcunt, so they feel a burning sensation deep in the asspussy like ICYHOT. Bastion is a way of life for me, I never change my character fuck you. If at any point during the match you want me to change characters, I gladly suggest you go fuck yourself. I follow absolutely no type of team composition. If you wanna give orders, give them to eachother, don't you dare bring that shit to me. All I know how to do is go in there, get a lotta poopoo on my Peter, and a lot of shit on my dick from stickin' it straight up their ass. Now, let's go team.",

Piss off, guys spend your hard-earned money on BattleBit Remastered instead[/b]\n\n[b][u]Developer Review: [/u][/b] 🤷‍♂️\n+ BattleNet and Steam integration was very smooth. More games that use launchers should do this. This felt seamless and doesn't force us to use another launcher.\n\n- Some extra and subtle animations, and VFX were removed from Overwatch 1.\n\n[b][u]Publisher Review: [/u][/b] 👎\nI didn't want to make my reviews political, but I'm fed up. Go eat some manure and die Activision.\n\nGreedily manage Blizzard's IPs and forcing microtransactions down our throats, especially due to how successful those tactics have been in Call of Duty games.\n\nHow they handled Hong Kong.\n\nThey borked World of Warcraft, they borked Warcraft 3: Reforged, and they borked Overwatch 2's story PvE.\n\nBecause of how OW2 and other Blizzard game have been handled, I'm downvoting.\n\n[b][u]Steam Deck Review: [/u][/b] 🤷‍♂️ / 👍\n- Controller sometimes doesn't get recognized when loading into match; you're forced to quit the game and suffer the penalty.\n+ Game runs smoothly so far as long as it's installed in the SSD instead of microSD.\n\n[b][u]Dualsense Review: [/u][/b] 🤷‍♂️\n+ Adaptive triggers implementation is lame, but at least they're there and better than Witcher 3's adaptive triggers\n- For a competitive game, this is a missed opportunity to implement gyro aiming and flick stick.\n- No haptic feedback to complement adaptive triggers.\n\n[b][u]Game Review: [/u][/b] 👍\nYou gotta drop $15 or grind your battle pass to like level 69 to unlock the story missions. If you're already playing OW2 for a long time, just grind it out.\n\nIt's Overwatch 1.5. If you like Paladins or Team Fortress 2, give this a try. The game is still fun and polished. You'll find some overlap with Paladins. While Overwatch has better animations, polish,  and presentation, Paladins has more content, just as fun, and rough. Paladins is the better game, but both Overwatch 2 and Paladins are good. So give both a try.\n\nI like the new Push mode, it's a step up from the capture points in the first game. \n\nHeroes are still varied, interesting, and fun to play. Again, this game competes with Paladins and they both rip each other off. They game is still chaotic as ever and is a good time when you learn how to play your Hero effectively and coordinate with your team members.",

        "review": "bruh\nБыло время, когда Overwatch поглотил меня полностью. С утра до вечера, с вечера до утра мог сидеть с хорошей компанией каких-то людей с Белоруссии в чате игры, бросая снежные шары в е***ки друг друга. Со временем, к сожалению или к счастью, в игру пришлось заходить все реже и реже. Только изредка, чтобы посмотреть на нового персонажа, карту или ивент. Вскоре дальнейшие обновления становились однотипными и игра была заброшена. \n\nВ году так 2019-20, когда анонсировали вторую часть, я не мог найти себе место от счастья. Столько нового и интересного контента пообещали, что я был готов отдать любые деньги за это. Каким же я был наивным.\n\nДа, когда только вышла вторая часть, даже на первом бета-тесте, в котором мне посчастливилось поучаствовать, был эффект какой-то эйфории. Но когда эмоции уже прошли и пришлось взглянуть на игру в трезвом состоянии, то захотелось вновь забросить игру. Причина была проста: это была та же самая игра, только с улучшенной графикой. Что Близы сделали такого, чтобы называть игру сиквелом? Добавили трёх новых персонажей? Добавили парочку новых карт? Сделали один обоссанный режим? Но это была просто компенсация за всё то время, пока комьюнити приходилось просто ждать без всякой поддержки игры. Нет, они же пообещали сделать сюжетную компанию, где у каждого героя будет большая ветка прокачки, где появится смысл проходить задания не только на Легенду . А потом просто невзначай сказали: \"ну, мы уберем половину того, что мы пообещали вам, разделим PVE на кусочки и будем выпускать их, дай бог, раз в год. А ещё вы должны будете заплатить за них 15 долларов.\" 15 долларов за что? Чтобы пострелять в каких-то роботов пару минут и забросить? И никто не сказал, что в дальнейшем не надо будет платить за ещё пару часов такого гемплея.\n\nЧестно, я до конца надеялся, что Близы смогут сделать хороший сиквел. И они могли бы это сделать, но им захотелось побольше деньжат. Я уже молчу о том, что они выдали каждому, кто приобретал первую часть игры, скин какого-то клоуна и чела в кепке. Зато сейчас они завозят реально классные скины, которые стоят, как сама игра в те времена, а то и дороже. \n\nСкорее всего, новичкам даже понравится Overwatch. Именно PVP составляющая игры.

But guess who was too busy drinking 'milk' from the employee fridge instead of making PVE free, or even at the extent they promised. Thats right! Blizzard!!!! woo hoo!\nAnd guess whos trying to sell 3 PVE MISSIONS for the same price as OW. Thats right!!! The milk drinkers!!!!\n\nSkin system lost lootboxes and now expects you to pay hundreds of dollars to get what you couldve gotten in a couple hours of grinding an event. And if you WANTED to grind for skins via the built in 'credit system for challenges' it would take you roughly 5 years for them and them alone. No emotes, no voice lines. No heroes.\n\n0/10 I have 700 hours of my life sunk into this game and all light from this world is diminished, otherwise gone.",

The story missions are literally like any other event missions, but now you have to pay for them, even if you already bought the original game AND the Watchpoint pack (which in hindsight man was that shit a scam). Even if it's free do NOT give your money to this game, I just want them to realize that this model is terrible and deterring people from even touching the game.

        "review": "Team Fortress 2 is a team-based multiplayer first-person shooter developed by Valve Software as part of the game bundle The Orange Box. It was first released for Microsoft Windows and Xbox 360 on October 10, 2007. A PlayStation 3 version then followed on November 22, 2007. Following suit, it was released as a standalone title on April 9, 2008, and on June 10, 2010, Team Fortress 2 was released for Mac OS X. The PC and OS X versions of Team Fortress 2 adopted a \"Free to Play\" model on June 23, 2011, with all revenue being generated from microtransactions in the in-game Store. After several months of closed beta, Team Fortress 2 was finally released for Linux operating systems on February 14, 2013.\n\nThe game was first announced in 1998 as a sequel to the original Team Fortress mod for Quake (a first-person shooter video game, developed by id Software), but has since been through various concept and design periods. In 1999, the game appeared to be abandoning the art styles of the original Team Fortress Classic by transitioning toward a more realistic and militaristic style of gameplay. However, the design continued evolving over the game's nine-year development period and game engine switch. The final art style rendition of Team Fortress 2 resembles that of the original Team Fortress and Team Fortress Classic games, and also features a cartoon-like visual style based on the art of Dean Cornwell, J. C Leyendecker, and Norman Rockwell. Team Fortress 2 followed a popular trend in CGI films at the time, in particular, films made by Pixar, such as The Incredibles.\n\nThe absence of media information or apparent development progress for six years of the game's development caused it to be labeled as vaporware, and it was regularly featured in the Wired News' annual vaporware list, among gaming news outlets. Since its release, however, the game has received critical acclaim and several awards.\n\nLike its predecessors, Team Fortress 2 is centered around two opposing teams competing for an objective. These two teams are meant to represent a demolition and a construction company as a part of the backstory: Reliable Excavation Demolition (RED) and Builders League United (BLU). Players can choose to play as one of nine classes in these teams, each with their unique strengths, weaknesses, abilities, and roles. Although the abilities of some classes have changed from earlier Team Fortress incarnations, the essential elements of each class have remained.\n\nTeam Fortress 2 is the first of Valve's multiplayer games to incorporate detailed statistics for players. These statistics include the time spent playing as each class, the average point score, and the most captures or objectives achieved in a single round. Persistent statistics tell the player how they are improving concerning these statistics, such as if a player comes close to their record for the damage inflicted in a round. Team Fortress 2 also features numerous achievements for carrying out certain tasks, such as scoring a certain number of kills or completing a round within a certain time. New sets of class-specific achievements were added in updates after the main release. These have added new abilities and weapons to each class once unlocked by the player. Unlocked achievements and statistics from previously played games are displayed on the player's Steam Community or Xbox LIVE profile page.\n\nMaps\nMain article: List of maps\n\nOn the PC and OS X versions of Team Fortress 2, the initial release only included six official Valve maps, with several dozen more being added to the game over the years by Valve and the Team Fortress 2 community. On the console versions, however, these original six maps, all released by Valve, are still the only maps available. The official maps are commonly themed with an evil genius or retro-spy tech mentality, with secret bases that are concealed within industrial warehouses, as well as exaggerated super weapons such as laser cannons and missile launch facilities taking the role of objectives. During Halloween (called Scream Fortress) and Christmas (called Smissmas), several new maps are enabled that often feature Halloween and Christmas/winter themes respectively.\n\nWhen players joins certain maps for the first time, an introductory video shows them how to complete map objectives. Map player limits are 24 on the PC and OS X, although the player limit has been altered on some servers to reach as high as 32, while the player limit on the Xbox 360 and PlayStation 3 is 16.\n\nGame modes\nMain article: List of game modes\n\nTeam Fortress 2 shipped with three game modes: Capture the Flag, Control Point, and Territorial Control. Since the game's release, several new game modes have been added, such as Payload, Arena, and Mann vs. Machine. Several of these game modes feature both Valve-made and community-made maps. Several unused game modes have been discovered over the years.\n\nCustomization\nMain article: Customization\n\nSince the April 29, 2008 Patch, also known as the Gold Rush Update, the Loadout menu was introduced. This menu allowed the player to change their weapons and, with the introduction of cosmetic items in the Sniper vs. Spy Update, their cosmetic items (previously referred to as hats and miscellaneous items, or miscs) to change the appearance of their class.\n\nIn the Über Update, special taunts were added to the game as action slot items and were given their own loadout slot in the Love & War Update. Taunts allow players to perform certain animations, often used to taunt the enemy players after death. Some taunts are partner taunts, which allows two or more players to perform a taunt together (such as the Square Dance, which can be performed with one other player, and the Conga, which can be performed with many other players).\n\nThe Gun Mettle Update in 2015 introduced the Decorated quality, allowing players to customize the look of their weapons by applying different textures to them, later transitioning to the War Paint system with the Jungle Inferno Update in 2017.\n\nCosmetic items, taunts, and Decorated weapons can all feature special particle effects on them.\n\nDevelopment\nOrigins\nOriginally developed as a freeware mod for Quake, Team Fortress 2 switched to the GoldSrc engine in 1998 after the development team of Team Fortress Software – consisting of Robin Walker and John Cook - was first contracted and employed by Valve. At the time, Team Fortress 2 was called Valve's Team Fortress. At the point of Team Fortress Software's acquisition, production moved up a notch, and the game was promoted to a standalone, retail product to tide fans over since, as well as time issues, much of the Team Fortress player base had purchased Half-Life solely in anticipation of the free release of Team Fortress 2. Work began on a simple port of the game which was released in 1999 as the free Team Fortress Classic. Notably, Team Fortress Classic was built entirely within the publicly available GoldSrc Software Development Kit (SDK) as an example to the community and industry of its flexibility.\n\nWalker and Cook were heavily influenced by their three-month contractual stint at Valve and began working full-time on their design, which was undergoing rapid metamorphosis. Team Fortress 2 was to be a modern war game, with a command hierarchy including a commander, with a bird's-eye view of the battlefield; parachute drops over enemy territory; networked voice communication; and numerous other innovations.\n\nThe new design was revealed to the public at the 1999 Electronic Entertainment Expo (E3) where it earned several awards including Best Online Game and Best Action Game. By this time Team Fortress 2 had gained a new subtitle, \"Brotherhood of Arms\", and the results of Walker and Cook working at Valve were becoming evident. Several new, and at the time, unprecedented technologies were on show: parametric animation; seamlessly blended animations for smoother, more life-like movement; and Intel's multi-resolution",

Cuando te aburriste de la mecanica de un personaje tenes 30 héroes mas para probar. Te llama. Lo odias, odias a la comunidad, odias la falta de compañerismo- Pero cuando te vas alejando de el de lejos parece más lindo. Y volves.\n\n1- Ahora si pongan servidor latam\n2- Toniki vende patria.

Yes, they have fumbled with some decisions regarding it (such as not releasing new content for several years and promising a larger PvE experience than they could deliver), but at the end of the day, the PvP content is still there and, in my honest opinion, better than ever.\n\nThis was and still is one of the most fun PvP experiences out there and the current release cycle of new content is good. If you have somehow missed this game or, more likely, are trying to decide if you should come back to it, don't let the negative reviews stop you from trying it out.",
