Never cared about skins cosmetics never gived a damn. U should have more control over ur life and stop being addicted to complete pointless crap. They should make all skins 500$ price for all i care. I laugh at the losers who complain about this irrelevent stuff\n\nLots of people want to see other blizzrrd games on steam. Why the hell are you negative reviewing this one so muchj?

        "review": "[b]This Game was once a full price AAA title with casino loot box systems. But in my unpopular opinion, it was fine back then. Overwatch lootbox system was clearly one of the better ones out there, because it wasn't really worth using it and didn't used fomo very hard. But let me explain:\n\nYes, there were Events with time limited stuff and lootboxes, but none of the stuff was actually a \"real\" fomo, because if you missed anything, you could just wait until the event returns. That was fine and in my opinion one of the best systems I had in those types of games (even if you need to pay it) and better than any free to play game I played (or pay to play game).\n\n________________________________________________________________\n\nBut then, Overwatch 2 was announced, for the WHOLE REASON because it should get PVE Content. And they said they would make it free to play and stop the lootbox system. Everybody back then was like super hyped, but I was already kinda sceptical. Because yes they had lootboxes and sh*t. But if you think it from a \"fomo perspective\", that lootbox system was way more relaxing than battle passes that you (if you want to collect everything) HAVE TO grind out and never “forced you” to play the game in that regard. \n\n________________________________________________________________\n\n\nThen they released a \"Pre-Order Package\" for Overwatch 2. That included some skins and the PVE Mode was advertised in it too (Which they said it will come later to the game). At that time, we already saw the Ingame shop and the battlepass system. Not only does the game have a super slow battle pass to grind out (and all the fomo stuff I'm usually criticizing in my negative reviews).\n\nNo. It also contained a shop with 20€ (!) expensive skins for single heroes... And they changed the whole game system from 2 Tanks to 1 Tank, which they got also criticized for. They actually DELETED your bought copy of Overwatch 1 and replaced it with a \"OVerWaTCh 2\", copy with less content and game experience and cancelled stuff. Hell, they even needed to temporary delete heroes (which you probably also spend money for skins for) for like 2 weeks because they couldn’t nerf them.\n\nIf you bought Overwatch 1 back in the days (which was only like 6-7 years ago I think), you will NEVER be able to play it again! Because it got replaced with a sh*ttier free to play copy of the game with a horrible system of microtransactions, fomo and battle passes.\n\n________________________________________________________________\n\nAnd then afterwards in May 2023, we know how it went:\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CL-dGiiqUVw\n\nThey cancelled the PVE Mode. The WHOLE reason they justified the game in the first place. (Remember people already bought pre-order packages for it). In the same Dev Stream they also said, Overwatch 2 will contain some PVE Missions, which you might also need to pay for in the future :) I don’t even care about the gameplay and other stuff in this review. Of course the art is amazing and gameplay feels good (except the usual nerf stuff), because it’s a Blizzard game and they always deliver; and their art teams do great work in every one of their games<3 There were great guys that had a vision for the game, but Bobby and co. just saw it as a Cash cow that wants to get milked harder than a female Tauren in Stormwind. There was a reason Jeff Kaplan and nearly everybody of his team left.\n\n______________________________________________________________\n\n\nYou can’t call Overwatch 2 a “new game”, not even call if a “Prequel”. You can’t even call it an “Update”. I would call it a “Downgrade” from Overwatch 1 with much more scam and microtransactions included. I think that sums up the game pretty well.\n______________________________________________________________\n\nThis company and Bobby should go to hell. I hope Lillith, The Lichking, the old gods and Sargeras have a special place for them there.\n\nBut let me conclude with this video:\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MzKlmNLTkXM\n\nCan't wait to write my reviews for Hearthstone, World of Wracraft, Diablo and Starcraft <3[/b]\n\n",

Playing the game right now just isn't worth it as Blizzard as a company is just really unbelievably stupid. Hopefully despite how hands off Microsoft can be with their acquisitions, I really want them to try to save this game.",

Obviamente este juego no me puso caliente. no soy gay, yo tengo mucho sexo con mujeres reales como para gastar más de 15 minutos con cada una. Por otro lado me gustaría recomendar este juego a la gente que no tiene sexo, ni tuvo experiencia sexual (no como yo porque yo tengo mucho sexo con mujeres, mucho) como si ahí hubiese una mujer desnuda y está desnuda. Este juego se ve como una de mis varias novias con la que tuve mucho sexo. He tenido mucho sexo. También soy muy guapo y las mujeres SIEMPRE quieren tener sexo conmigo porque soy muy musculoso, y guapo, y muy bueno en los videojuegos y en el sexo. Todas mis novias dicen que soy muy bueno en el sexo y jugando videojuegos y siendo guapo. Una de mis enamoradas me pidió tener sexo con ella pero le dije que estaba jugando un juego de sexo y empezó a llorar y se hizo lesbiana y se suicidó porque no tuve sexo con ella. Tengo sexo con mujeres, no con hombres, no soy gay. Soy muy cool y guapo así que las chicas siempre quieren tener sexo conmigo porque soy muy cool y sexy. Si quieres algo que sea lo mas parecido a tener sexo con mujeres juega a este juego que es puro sexo no gay.",

Боже.\n Столько людей ждало, мы думали о ИГРЕ о КАЧЕСТВЕ, все катсцены сейчас можно глянуть на ют и они идут 20 мин.\nКакой же смех видеть на твиче восхищающихся америкосов, проплаченных и орущих, мол как же важно купить мне это ПВЕ\nРебят, что происходит с игрой, чьи старые синиматики я уже как традиция, пересматриваю раз в год зимой перед НГ. \nЧто происходит с поддержкой.. Делали скины по пол года-год? Серьёзно? А эти несчастные три миссии за ПОЛТОРЫ ТЫСЯЧИ рублей, первая кстати полностью готова была еще в 2019.\nМне приятно, что на игру не забили до конца, но верить этим типам, что после Такой обновы (по сравнению с прошлыми сезонами и упаси всех от воспоминания о унылейшем 5 сезоне) что-то годное будет или будет на том же уровне уже не приходится.. Онлайн вырос, а будет ли контент для каждого? Что за муссор в баттлпассе? 4-5 скинов за либо рубли либо 3 сезона еженедельных выполнений заданий на золотые монетки... Это работа, а не развлечение.\nПока что, на этом сезоне (6-м) Рекомендую попробовать, атмосфера ранее сделанных в 2016г карт завлечет, а новые... Просто надеюсь что эта игра - Феникс, и восстанет она из собственного пепла.\nPS: Меч-пушка-лазер-хилка у нового перса кринж eбаный ИМХО",

My anticipation soared, and I eagerly looked forward to plunging into a realm that, until then, had only existed within my nights of curiosity.\n\nHowever, disappointment set in as I realized that the magic I had envisioned was notably gone. Watching the characters in-game felt like a lackluster experience; their interactions failed to capture the same level of engagement that had once drawn me in. It was disheartening to witness these beloved characters deviate from their true essences.\n\nYet, despite the letdown, there was a redeeming glint of something worthwhile. The voices that accompanied the characters were well-executed, conveying their unique traits with accuracy. Nevertheless, even with this accomplishment, I couldn't shake the feeling that something was amiss. The delight I had grown accustomed seemed strangely absent, as the events I had hoped to witness unfold never quite materialized, particularly in the story mode.\n\nNonetheless, even this redeeming quality couldn't overshadow the overall disconnection I felt. The mismatch between my expectations and the game's reality was undeniable, and it left me disenchanted.\n\nIn the end, the allure I had hoped for didn't materialize, leaving me with a sense of detachment and disillusionment. The stark reminder that not all journeys lead to the desired destination was a testament to the dissonance between my initial excitement and the eventual experience.\n\n",

Gra dalej jest niezbalansowana i nieprzystosowana do tego 5v5 + fakt, że nie wszyscy mogą mieć wszystkie postacie pogłębia ten problem (imagine nie mieć dostępnych wszystkich postaci w grze opartej na dopasowaniu się do sytuacji i kontrowaniu przeciwnika, jak w pierwszej części)\n\nGeneralnie mówiąc to nic się nie zmieniło przez ten rok od premiery Ov2, gra dalej jest chujowa jak nie jeszcze gorsza, ale hej, możemy kupić misje za 60 ziko, które dadzą nam masę zabawy :D\n\n\n\n na jakieś 2 godziny....\n\n\nDopóki blizzard się nie ogarnie to serio, nie traćcie czasu na te grę, nie warto",

        "review": "i have over 500 hours on overwatch and overwatch 2 combined, spanning from xbox and battle.net. while i would've considered it one of my favourite multiplayer games of all time back then, it has significantly fallen from grace. in my personal opinion, they are ONLY putting this on steam to try and milk steam players of more money, considering the fact the game hasn't been doing as well as they would've hoped for. ubisoft is known for doing this as well.\n\nall i can say is GET OUT WHILE YOU CAN. please do not support this game and activision blizzard for constantly lying to the community and turning overwatch 2 into what is essentially a free to play patch for overwatch 1. almost EVERYTHING that had been promised in overwatch 2 (aka the whole reason to justify a new game) has either been indefinitely delayed or completely cancelled. supporting this company with your money means you are supporting activision blizzards immoral and extremely anti-consumer practices.\n\nif you're interested in just the gameplay, then by all means go ahead and try it out. in my opinion the game is still rather fun, especially with friends. just PLEASE do not give this game any of your money.\n\npromising an entire fully fleshed out pve mode with skill trees and replayable missions and then outright cancelling it and then selling 3 small pve missions with next to no replayability for $15 each is the biggest middle finger you can give to your community. i am still shocked how quickly activision blizzard managed to lose all the trust they had spent YEARS building up in their entire playerbase.\n\noverwatch 2 is the perfect example of when greed rears its ugly head and takes over all thinking. all they care about is your money.",
