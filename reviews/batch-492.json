        "review": "I had roughly 2800 hours in Overwatch 1 when it ended and was just under Masters rank. Overwatch was the first fps game I got into competitively, it gave me the enjoyment I got from league of legends heroes system in a more fast paced and fun environment. Overwatch imo never had the greatest ranked system, balance team, or matchmaking (LoL did a much better job), but it was still a game I could take seriously competitively and over time your skill did put you in the rank you belonged. Overwatch 2 threw that all out the window. The game has lost all competitive integrity. Matchmaking is worse, balance team is worse, it gets FAR more bugs than OW1 ever did, Blizzard boosted 40% of low rank players to fill out the less populated higher ranks, and 5v5 causes severe role imbalance and breaks the tank role.\n\nI want this review to focus on the game itself so let’s get this out of the way now… the monetization is the worst in the competitive live service genre. That should come as no surprise…it is after all, Activision/Blizz. Moving on. \n\n[u]From 6v6 to 5v5[/u]\n\nAs a tank main, I was optimistic about 5v5. Having all the power of the tank role in my hands sounded awesome to me. Turns out it sucks…really bad. Overwatch was built to function in a way where every role (tank, dps, and support) enabled another role, and nobody could really do their job if they weren’t being efficiently enabled by another role. Tank was the hardest role in OW1 but the value you could provide was tremendous. Tanks enabled dps by taking space, and supports by peeling. By peeling you directly enabled your supports which is the role that enables tanks by healing them through all the damage they soak. Tanks controlled the flow of the game. They pressured front lines, back lines and peeled for supports. 5v5 removed a tank from each team and this resulted in tanks that just can’t really do the job they were built to do. There is a downside to every decision a tank makes. It is fundamentally a broken role. \n\nIf you pressure backline, you leave the opposing tank to run on your team. If you peel for your supports, on many tanks you just get CC’d, debuffed, shot in the back and annihilated. If you pressure front line, you’re really just feeding support ults because supports are insanely strong now and have crazy high healing numbers. This results in a bunch of low IQ players saying “tank diff” that expect the tank to always be doing something they’re not. Since there’s a downside to every decision a tank makes, stupid people get toxic towards the tank because the downside happened. \n\nSince tanks can’t really peel anymore, they had to megabuff the support role so they could fight off the dps flanking them. Now we have supports that are literally just dps with better abilities that keep them alive and provide powerful utility. \n\nIn OW1 every role was pretty balanced in comparison to each other. In OW2 support is OP, dps is great, tank sucks. \n\nTanks suck because it’s so incredibly easy to negate the role by hard countering it. It’s a lot easier to switch to hard counter 1 person than it is to switch to hard counter 2 people. For example in OW1 if the opposing team had a good Hog player, someone would switch to Ana to counter the Hog but then Hogs tank team mate would switch to Dva to counter the Ana. It just made countering balanced as there was always a way to lessen the impact it has, and if someone switched to counter 1 tank, they likely weren’t countering the other tank. Not so much in OW2…tanks are hit hard by counters. Tanking in diamond + in OW2 is literally just constantly switching to avoid 5 people switching to hard counter you ALL THE TIME. It’s obnoxious as hell. On top of that, it’s meta to throw discord on the tank which makes them take 30% more damage from all sources, all forms of CC will be thrown at the tank, and the moronic balance team just keeps increasing the amount of damage dps and supports do just to make playing tank even worse than it already is. All of this makes tanking a pain in the ass to play and the game is seemingly in the largest tank player shortage we’ve ever seen, with competitive tank queues at 5-15 seconds while everything else is several minutes, and players saying that when a tank leaves their quick play game they don’t even get a backfill tank a lot of times because so few people are queuing for it. \n\n\n[u]Matchmaking and Competitive mode[/u]\n\nIn OW1 comp tank queues were 1 minute, dps queues were 10 minutes+, Support queues were around 4 minutes. This was just due to role popularity but matchmaking was fairly balanced…enough for a solo queuer to climb with. OW2 Season 1 we were seeing 10+ minute tank queues, 4 minute dps queues, and 1 minute support queues. Same matchmaking as OW1 but role popularities had shifted around. OW2 Season 2 suddenly we’re seeing 1 minute queue times across the board. Hmmmm how did this happen?? People who examined profiles of their team mates (since blizzard decided to hide everyones ranks in attempt to cover this up), found that they were getting Bronze players in their Diamond games and Gold players in their Grandmaster games. The skill gaps were just MASSIVE and turned comp mode into a complete joke…so the community complained as expected and how Blizzard handled this just blew my mind. This really goes to show just how low Blizz has fallen.\n\nIn Seasons 3 and 4 there were dev updates that stated they improved matchmaking. Matchmaking appeared to be getting better. We were seeing far less skill gaps in our matchmaking and by Season 4 it was pretty much gone…on the surface at least. Blizzard fooled many people by doing this, but what was actually happening was Blizzard boosted random low rank players to fill out the less populated higher ranks in order to retain the fast queue times. Proof https://imgur.com/a/giNMqas\n\nThat link shows someone who was a Gold support player all through OW1, never played enough to even place in Seasons 1 & 2 of OW2, S3 they were Gold, and S4 they placed DIAMOND for winning TWO games. The last pic shows their win rate percentages with support heroes in S4 at 21%, 19%, and 17%. This person literally skipped over THE ENTIRE PLATINUM RANK FOR LOSING. During the time this screen shot was taken, I was seeing this kind of stuff in EVERY SINGLE GAME. There was always some garbage players that just stuck out obviously boosted and when examining their profile, it confirmed they were boosted. The worst one I saw was a tank player that was silver in all of OW1 and OW2 until S3 they moved from Silver to MASTERS for winning 9 games . That’s a climb that would have taken an over 40 game winning streak in OW1. I tank diffed this guy so hard everyone reported him as throwing but I knew he was one of the random chosen to be boosted lol. \n\nSo essentially, OW2 is still putting Bronze players in Diamond games and Gold players in GM games. The only difference is the Bronze player now has a Diamond badge and the Gold player now has a GM badge. This has completely killed competitive. It’s just simply not a competitive system anymore, it’s a casual quick play mode with medals. \n\n\n[u]Balance[/u]\n\nHonestly it doesn’t even seem like these guys are trying to balance the game anymore, it seems like they’re just trying to force metas and of course they keep all the new heroes OP so new players will buy them. \nThis new balance team is awful. They’ve tried to nerf heroes and accidentally buff them, they’ve said “it’s okay that this hero is OP cause she’s not OP in Gold”, showing that they’re now balancing for casuals? They just added more CC to the game and more damage to make playing tank even more miserable. GM/Top 500 Overwatch content creators always give great feedback and balance suggestions but it’s always ignored. This team just does whatever they want to the game and ignore all community feedback. If they actually listened to the players, we wouldn’t have this garbage 5v5 in the first place. \n\ngg OW2 suck",

But after some Time now it just feels worse than Overwatch 1 which was the Game i purchased and i'd like to still be able to play it but i cant anymore. Im am dissappointed what this game has become but playing it is just frustating now and even the PvE which was the whole Reason for calling this Overwatch 2 has been cancelled. So the only real changes that make it a new Game are making it 5v5 and removing many Systems and Things that the first Game had, for Example Lootboxes, LFG, Cards and the on Fire System. They may have added it back now but it never shouldve been taken out",

Así que dejaré esto aquí.\n\nOverwatch 2 representa una experiencia de diversión y adicción sin igual. Su atractivo es universal, atrayendo tanto a quienes no tuvieron la oportunidad de experimentar la entrega original como a los veteranos. Los personajes irradian dinamismo, cobrando vida con una energía cautivadora, mientras que las emocionantes adiciones al juego añaden una capa fresca de emoción. En resumen, estamos frente a un título que indiscutiblemente justifica cada momento invertido en él.",

        "review": "This game used to be great when it first came out. My friends and I have put countless hours this game for the first two years of its life. Then it progressively got worse as time went on. Balance patches were inconsistent. Dive meta for SO LONG. GOATS META. Then we have role queue. It is not bad but i do miss being able to switch from tank to dps to healer because my teammate is bad at the game. At the end of Overwatch 1 this game was left in the dust for Overwatch 2! Hooray! SIKE THEY JUST WANT YOUR WALLET. Old/new skins costing too much money. I've earned every skin I own for free. Now I have to pay to blizzard money with an overpriced skin? Ridiculous. New heroes in the battle pass instead of it being free like in Overwatch 1. If the new heroes are meta and you don't have them because you didnt buy the premium battle pass or did not have enough time to play to earn it for free reaching tier like 50 then good luck playing ranked and I know the new heroes are disabled in ranked for 2 weeks but not everyone has time to grind to tier 50 to unlock the new heroes for free. Overwatch 2 is also a 5v5 now. They couldnt fix the double shield meta FOR 3 YEARS or the game was too fast-paced so its 5v5 now. You like playing duo tank with your buddy like I did, too bad. No more rein zarya, winston dva, orisa hog, etc. All gone. Upsetting. Only 1 tank per team. Then ranking system in this game is also terrible. They did a recalibration of the ranks and everyone got boosted up to masters/grandmasters in 1 ranked season. They just handed it out high ranks for free and im stuck playing with player who most of them do not belong there. Sojourn was OP when she first came out and the samething with Kiriko and Ramatra. AND they still took TOO LONG to do any balance patches. Unbelievable. Then the campaign we were promised. What were they working on for 3 years? Honestly I dont even know but now they want to charge us a campaign full of things we are not getting with the replay ability with the skill trees and everything. Its just not the same. Lying to us the whole time knowing they could not fulfill their promise to us for the campaign. Just disrespectful. I understand Blizzard is not too fully blame its also Activsion and their corrupt company. Money hungry scumbags. I want this game to succeed and thrive like how it was in 2016 but I dont think that will ever happen. New players, sure try it out but don't expect to be blown away or to be disappointed when blizzard messes up again. As for old veteran players like me, I hate the path Overwatch has went down. I will play it here in there for nostalgia and for my favorite heroes but thats it. Blizzard/Activision killed Overwatch for most of the old players.",

        "review": "Overview:\nOverwatch(2) is such a great example of why these AAA titles in gaming are awful. Overwatch(2) lacks so many features you would want from a game like it is crazy. No meaningful progression, no rewards, 20$ skins, shitty battle-pass that does not give you premium credit.\nGameplay:\nI have nearly 2000 hours in Overwatch and Overwatch(2). You a fan of fps games? Well, you will hate Overwatch(2). You a fan of MOBAs? Well, you will hate Overwatch(2). This game tries so hard to appeal to everyone that it fails to appeal to anyone. You will be slowed, you will be stunned, you will be one-shot and you will have 5 ults shit out at once and die with no counter-play. Switching to a single tank made the game VERY rock-paper-scissors like the game feels so taletless, at least for tank players. \nMonetization: \nAny self-respecting person will avoid Blizzard games. These games are Greed itself. Shit skins sold for 20 bucks and a shit battlepass sold for 10. You DO NOT earn premium coins from the battle-pass, you earn just regular coins that get you all the bad, ugly, or old items of the game. This game IS NOT free-to-play. The (PvE) or what is left of it is 15 bucks for 3 missions that I can't speak on because I will not subject myself to playing them.\nAbout Blizzard:\nThe Overwatch(2) team has proven time and time again that they CANNOT balance this game. They are bringing CC abilities back for no real reason and have left characters like Kirko with broken abilities for 6 months. The game is a broken mess in terms of technical work and balance. You like playing a cool character like Mei? That sucks because Blizzard has just decided to nerf her and ruin her play-style for no reason! This happens all the time. Doom, Roadhog, Sombra, Sym, and so on all just killed for Blizzard balance. Blizzard has no idea if they want Overwatch(2) to be a competitive game or a usual game so at this point it is neither. \nQuick Notes:\n-Matching making sucks and you will suffer.\n-Comp is a joke.\n-The new gamemode is just KOTH but worse.\nPlease respect yourself and play anything else over this.",

Stworzenie drugiej części było istnym strzałem w kolano, wiele rzeczy zostało tutaj źle zrobionych jak na przykład: płatne postacie, usunięcie skrzynek ze skinami. Mówiąc o cenach skinów są bardzo drogie trzeba się liczyć z tym że jeżeli chcesz mieć jakiegoś fajnego skina musisz zapłacić 15 euro (w pierwszej odsłonie można było dostać takiego skina praktycznie za darmo). Tryb PvE to jakaś porażka bardzo nudne misje jak za taką cenę. Nowe postacie są nie zbalansowane, mapy są akurat ciekawe ale częstotliwość pojawiania się takowych jest bardzo mała. Podsumowywując: Dodanie Overwatcha na steam było czystym skokiem na kasę, wiele rzeczy zostało zrobionych źle, ceny skinów są chorendalnie wysokie, battle pass się nie zwraca, postacie są niezbalansowane a tryb PvE to jakiś żart. Na + oceniam mapy które są fajnie zrobione i przyjemnie się na nich gra. Daję ocenę pozytywną tylko z sentymentu do 1.",

The core gameplay of its PvP is fun to play and engaging overall despite its issues. The balance and gameplay changes are somewhat questionable but that is a minor issue in regards to the real problems.\n\nBesides the gameplay, it is unfortunate to see the path that this game has taken because of Activision/Blizzard's greed and deception. They somehow managed to downgrade and remove existing content from the first game and dish it back to the playerbase in a \"sequel\", giving the illusion of new content and change. Also, they wasted years of effort on a PvE mode that will never be fully realized and has been now squandered. I never cared that much for a PvE mode for Overwatch, but finding out that all the effort put into creating the PvE gamemode only for it to be scrapped almost entirely is a huge shame. Not to mention that the price for this new Invasion PvE gamemode costs less than a regular legendary hero skin when it was initially free to unlock by just playing the game is laughable.\n\nI hate that I have to leave a bad review for this game because I think this game could become better under a better company, but I refuse to support what they have done to this game. I only hope that if this franchise is acquired fully through Microsoft's acquisition, then this game can reach a better state than it is currently in, because clearly Activision/Blizzard doesn't understand what they are doing with this franchise...",
