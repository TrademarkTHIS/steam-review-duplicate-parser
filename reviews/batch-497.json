Even the Overwatch 1 skins that originally just took some grinding to get are now locked behind a paywall as well (This game makes the original lootbox system look like an amazing feature). Hero based game where new players don't have access to all the heros, some heros locked behind 40 tiers of the battlepass for free to play players. Features like the leveling system were taken out for OW 2 for some unknown reason, story is a fraction of what was promised (and still costs $15 just for 3 missions), the hero mastery mode that was a big thing for season 6 doesn't even come out for another month. I do enjoy the gameplay and I do come back for it occasionally because no other game feels like this, but with almost no skins / levels to grind for as someone who doesn't want to spend my money on the game, I just play a few matches and log off for another month.",

        "review": "Overwatch 2 is the most vile mistreatment of a game I have ever seen. The original Overwatch had issues, but was a fun competitive game to pick up and play from time to time that myself and many others had nostalgia for. Overwatch 2 ruined all that. \n\nThe freely obtainable loot box system was replaced with a store that charges $20 for a single skin, the non-gameplay relevant but rewarding leveling system was replaced by a battlepass and within this battlepass is placed new heroes that used to be given to players immediately for free. Here? Pay money for the hero or spend an absurd amount of your time grinding daily to get them for free. Now do that every single update or you'll fall behind on heroes and HAVE to spend money to have a full roster!  \n\nNow the game itself. Overwatch's gameplay has proven to be deeply flawed at a core level, flaws that are unfixable with a sequel update and minor balancing changes. The Tank and Team number adjustments have done little to fix the game, You stomp the other team or you get stomped. That's it. Maybe in every 10 games, you'll find a match that feels evenly balanced and have a good time, but the 9 other games aren't worth it. It is a miserable experience. \n\nPair all this with the fact that Blizzard canned their ambitious PVE mode, aka the entire reason they made a sequel game to begin with, and you really see what this game is. This isn't a sequel, this is taking an existing and successful game and reworking it in as many ways as possible to drain money from your playerbase. The Invasion Update being charged DLC is even further proof of this.\n\nAnd worst of all? This garbage completely replaced the original Overwatch, making it impossible to go back and play the original. Fuck you Blizzard.",

You are not bere to receive a gift nor have you been called here by the individual you assume. Though you have indeed been called. You have all been called here. Into a labyrinth of sounds and smells, misdirection and misfortune. A labyrinth with no exit, a maze with no prize- you don't even realize that you are trapped. Your lust for blood has driven you in endless circles, chasing the cries of children in some unseen chamber, always seeming so near. It's somehow out of reach, but you will never find them. \nNone of you will. This is where your story ends. \nAnd to you, my brave volunteer, who somehow found this job listing not intended for you. Although there was a way out planned for you, I have a feeling that's not what you want. I have a feeling that you are right where you want to be. \nI am remaining as well, I am nearby.\nThis place will not be remembered, and the memory of everything that started this can finally begin to fade away as the agony of every tragedy should. \nAnd to you monsters trapped in the corridors- be still, and give up your spirits, they dont belong to you. For most of you, I believe there is peace and perhaps warm, waiting for you after the smoke clears. \nAlthough for one of you, the darkest pit of hell has opened to swallow you whole. So dont keep the devil waiting \"friend\".\nMy daughter, if you can hear me, I knew you would return as well. It's in your nature to protect the innocent. I'm sorry on that day- the day you were shut out and left to die- no one was there to lift you up into their arms, the way you lifted others into yours. And then what became of you. I should have know you wouldn't be content to disappear, not my daughter. I couldn't save you then, so let me save you now. It's time to rest. For you, and for those you have carried in your arms. \nThis ends for all of us.\nEnd communication.",

This experience is like a shiny gem, meticulously crafted and polished to perfection. It's like they've taken everything great about the original Overwatch and elevated it to a whole new level of enjoyment. \n\nFrom the moment you dive into this rebalanced version, you'll notice the delightful changes that make the gameplay more engaging than ever. It's as if the game has been given a rejuvenating potion, with every hero, every map, and every mode tweaked to create a more satisfying and exhilarating adventure. It's a refreshing take on what was already a fantastic foundation.\n\n\nThing is, people will hate anything these days....even if Tracer comes out of the monitor and lets you tickle her Coochie, people will still cry....\n\nJust play and Enjoy!",

However and ima play Devil's advocate here OW2 as a whole is ironically one of the cheaper \"live service\" games out there which is pretty sad when you think about it I think it's around Street Fighter 6/ Apex levels some parts better some parts worse.\nesp compared to Valorant(dear god).\nSO yeah thats my take, I feel the internet as a whole can be tunnel vision'd in their hate for a product and sometime forget, that their prob getting boned harder.\nimo the game is good, but it's up to you.\nNow for the question you basement dwellers want to know:\nIs to better than TF2?\nEasy answer: they aren't exactly comparable imo and similarities are surface levels. It's like saying if Street Fighter or Tekken is better lmao.\nReal answer:\nThe Better game is easily..*connection terminated*",

Stripped of key features, slapped horrible monetization on it , brought it back and called it Overwatch 2. 2 as in basically change nothing but :\"the reason we took down the original is because the \"2\" is coming in the form of a full fledged PVE campaign someday that we couldnt finish yet but just wait yall will get it\". \n\nThen 9 months into \"Overwatch \"2\"\", they cancel that mf and root back further by bringing back the PVE, the whole reason the first game wasnt further developed properly, in form of short story missions. THE FORMAT. THAT THEY HAD IN THE PREDECESSOR. \n\nIn their planning. They cancel production, to make a new product, to realize they cant make the product, and go back and make the old one but worse. \n\nTHE SUCCESSOR. THE PRODUCT THAT SHOULD BE A BETTER/IMPROVED VERSION. Is turned into an anorexic version of itself that then turns obese again with the brainless, degenerative monetization.\n\nThere are so many words and all of them combined, in infinite sentences, couldnt come close to describe how BAD this game, IP and company has outdone themselves. \n\nF*ck the blizzard execs for ruining one of the best IP's and being too greedy and moronic to actually convert one of the biggest alley-oops of intellectual property into quality and long lasting products.",

Et c’est assez curieux de se dire que les hasards, les rencontres forgent une destinée… Parce que quand on a le goût de la chose, quand on a le goût de la chose bien faite, le beau geste, parfois on ne trouve pas l’interlocuteur en face, je dirais, le miroir qui vous aide à avancer. Alors ce n’est pas mon cas, comme je le disais là, puisque moi au contraire, j’ai pu ; et je dis merci à la vie, je lui dis merci, je chante la vie, je danse la vie… Je ne suis qu’amour ! Et finalement, quand beaucoup de gens aujourd’hui me disent : « Mais comment fais-tu pour avoir cette humanité ? » Eh bien je leur réponds très simplement, je leur dis que c’est ce goût de l’amour, ce goût donc qui m’a poussé aujourd’hui à entreprendre une construction mécanique, mais demain, qui sait, peut-être simplement à me mettre au service de la communauté, à faire le don, le don de soi…\n\nBref...

When trying to learn a new hero in Quick Play, or just trying to chill with friends, entire teams will counterpick you and trash talk you constantly when you struggle. \n- Clueless devs in charge of game balance. They will gigabuff characters seemingly at random, make several minor, irrelevant tweaks to others, all while characters that desperately need adjustment are ignored for multiple seasons. \n- Despite the devs stating that this is not their intention, counterpicking is heavily rewarded over player skill. Many games are decided in the character select menu rather than on the battlefield. Expect frequent mirror matchups as a result, especially as you climb in rank, and for games to be held hostage by teammates who refuse to switch. \n- Once free content (skins, heroes, pve missions) is now either locked behind a paywall, or made incredibly tedious to unlock without paying. In the case of heroes, it hurts the competitive integrity of the game when each team does not have equal access to resources. This is also an insult to the people who have stuck by for years, only to be told they now need to insert more cash to further enjoy the game.\n- The game is buggier than ever before. The renowned Blizzard polish is no longer present as they try to rush out as much content as possible, regardless of the outcome. It is incredibly rare to play a match without having at least one death or missed kill be attributed to a bug. \n\nOverwatch will always be special to me which is why it’s so heartbreaking to see it suffer through greed and mismanagement. You might enjoy the game but it’s no secret that the good days of Overwatch are long gone.",
