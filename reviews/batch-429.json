Prior to that, I had mostly played Call of Duty and some LEGO games. Overwatch completely shifted my perspective on video games. It instilled in me a sense of hope, inspiring me to consider a future in coding I'm currently going to western Connecticut university for computer science.\n\nEven now, with the Overwatch League facing challenges and the meta struggling, I still hold onto hope with each new update. However, I recently have had $40 purchase on Steam for the new story mode to not even give me my stuff. It seems like a simple issue that could have been prevented by temporarily disabling in-game purchases on Steam. As a result, my optimism for the game's future has gone way lower then it has ever gone.\n\nPerhaps, there's a glimmer of hope with the Microsoft merger, leading to improved management. If not, it's disheartening to realize that the game I fell in love with back in 2016 might never regain its former glory.",

        "review": "Been playing this since early OW1 days (have well over 1000 hours played), and let me say there are probably few people out there like me that actually want this game to eventually succeed. The reality, however, is that the company making the game cares little for the community and is merely milking the wallets of people who are new to this IP or simply too in love with the game to uninstall it for good. \n\nThere's simply nothing good about it. The PvP game is a shadow of what it was and still, after seven years, far from being balanced in a sensible way. Matchmaking is getting worse with every season, and that's because the design of OW2 is really geared towards fast queue times (presumably to compete with other multiplayer titles) -- they removed one tank from role queue because almost no one was or is queuing for tank. Then they relaxed the SR/MMR range of lobbies to shorten the wait, but that means quality has to suffer because you can either have quality matchmaking or fast matchmaking, never both. Quickplay is somewhat more enjoyable, but since it's become a revolving door it only makes sense as a practice range. \n\nI'm not saying you shouldn't try it out, after all, it's free. Oh, about that, you'll have to grind quite a bit to get access to all the heroes, and customization options like voice lines, intros, skins, etc. are locked behind a battle pass. After some backlash Blizzard decided to make the old OW1 skins purchaseable with a special type of in-game currency that you can earn by just playing, but you have to play a lot to gain a meaningful amount.\n\nAs for the PvE....the promise of this game was that we would get a full story campaign with character progression, skill trees, lots of lore to discover. After a few years of letting OW1 gather dust while a few brave souls still played it out of pure passion for the core concept, we were all told that OW2 would be free to play, and the PvE element would be a separate, standalone game to be released a bit later. This year, Blizzard didn't want to admit but they just didn't want to sell the PvE game for $70 when they can sell it piecemeal to make several times that amount over time. So...they canceled PvE, now they released a small sliver of PvE that isn't worth anyone's time, and they even said not to expect any more of that until next year at the earliest. Well... make of that what you may, but keep in mind that Blizzard didn't want to admit that it wasn't able to attract enough talent to make the game they promise (bad reputation for low pay, high expectations, crunch culture, and toxic management). \n\nTLDR: Blizzard made a game called Overwatch, re-released it in 2022, and now re-released it on Steam before it will kill it for good. If you never played this game before, there are better things to do with your time. Baldur's Gate, Starfield, etc.",

Now to get to the real stuff... I am offend and emotionally damaged that there is no overwatch porn built into the client of the game as if I go 6-8 hours without \"yanking the chain\" I become unable to function as a human being and I require many hot female characters (widow, annie from LoL, etc...\") in order to get plat in all three roles. \n\n\nTo whom it may concern/blizzard employees, \n\nStop sexually harassing your female employees, we understand their is a reason they make .77 to a dollar, but that is not a reason to be meanie poo poo heads to them. Please continue to make a game that used to be good even worse with every fear came update. consider my call to make the game have porn built into the client and this game will be as booming as peak fortnite. Thank you so much for reading and I hope one day to work at blizzard and make my beloved 23$ an hour with a masters in game design/engineering. \n\n\nMuch love, John Smith... XOXO luv u",

        "review": "Firstly, I think it’s important for me to state that I’ve been playing Overwatch since its debut in 2016. I’ve been through it all. I’ve seen it all. And let me just tell you, it ain’t pretty. I used to be completely obsessed and absolutely loved this game when it was first released. I made it a goal to collect all the hero skins, and try to get as many achievements as I possibly could. A lot of people complained about the Lootbox system, but now look… Now if we want a skin, we have to bust out our wallets. It’s completely ruined collecting for me because now I won’t be able to own all the skins. I refuse to pay for them. We should be able to win the skins through achievements and progression. But no, Blizzard is a greedy company. Not only that, they’re lying, conniving, sexist pigs. I stopped playing Overwatch and all Blizzard games when it came out that women were being SA/SH in the workplace. This is where they began to fall. I sat back and watched as their ship began to sink. Then, they started making all these promises with Overwatch 2. I was legitimately excited for PVE. I always wanted PVE and more lore. And finally, I thought we were getting it. So, I came back. I pushed Blizzard’s faults aside as if I was coming back to an abusive ex. I was weary but hopeful. I opened the game on Overwatch 2 release day, only to be bombarded with endless bugs and crashes. Some may say it’s a normal occurrence for a new release. Sure, fine. But this went on for months. Not only that, they kept pushing back PVE, promising it would come soon. So, I stayed and paid for Battlepasses that were grindy AF. If you have a fulltime job, there’s no way you would be able to complete all your dailies and weeklies. They made sure people were forced to play the game longer than necessary. Their desperateness was showing. They needed to keep their numbers up. But I stayed and continued to suffer through it and all the F2P Toxic Teammates and constant leavers. And then… they announced PVE was canceled. Thrown out the window. Years of hard work from the entire OW team completely trashed. It’s no wonder so many quit their jobs with Blizzard. The sad part is, back at Blizzcon 2019, we already saw progress of the PVE. We saw demos and the Hero Skill Tree they planned to do. All gone. Oh, but, they’re giving us PVE missions that we have to pay for in order to play. Why? So I can go play the missions a couple times and get bored like I did with the Archives Events? Absolutely pathetic. And now that they’ve moved to Steam is even more laughable. Again, their desperateness is showing. They’re so desperate for people to continue playing this game. Well, have fun receiving mostly negative reviews, Blizz. I hope this company crashes and burns.",

        "review": "Never played the first game before, but from what I've heard everyone seems to agree that the old game was better in nearly every aspect. From what I've experienced in the second game, the game play itself isn't too bad, it's just that everything around it is. Very.\n\nStarting to play the game, a large amount of the heroes are locked. After I played the game for a considerable amount of time, it became clear to me that they were behind a paywall and unless you didn't want to spend money in the game, you would have to put a lot of hours into the game. There are even some heroes that are behind battle passes, which is a huge problem when part a large part of the game is counter-picking heroes against your opponent. Any level of pay-to-win has no place in a competitive FPS at all. This made me even more disgruntled when hearing that the first game had no locked heroes at all.\n\nAdditionally, this game has a pretty bad matchmaking system. Just playing quick play, I managed to rack up over a 12-game loss streak despite me playing not bad at all and playing with friends who were better than me. I understand this is just a casual game mode and I may have gotten unlucky with who i was going against and who i had on my team, but I've never had this happen to me in any game before. This is an even bigger issue for me after learning that there are deliberate systems in the game to not put such unequally skilled players in a single game. Losing and getting steamrolled certainly isn't fun at all, and apparently this issue even extends to competitive matchmaking which is obviously really bad.\n\nMy biggest gripe with this game, however, are these terrible blunders that Blizzard keeps making. I've already mentioned a bit of the microtransactions with heroes, but the microtransactions in general are way too egregious even for a F2P game. One really scummy thing I encountered was Gingerbread Bastion being in the shop for 1 Overwatch coin. At that point I had about 20 hours into the game and no coins at all. Trying to earn any was nearly impossible, and if I wanted to buy just one coin, I would've had to get 500 at $5. Why not just make it free at that point? I went through the hassle of trying to grind out the game to get some coins for free last-second before the skin went away in the shop and I eventually gave up. My gf actually gifted me some coins so that I could get the skin, but for some stupid reason it took over 24 hours for the coins to show up in my account, way after the skin was gone.\n\nAside from that very dumb and frustrating situation, I have to mention what they've done to the PVE mode. Everybody knows that story at this point and how ridiculous of a decision that was, but now they're putting out PVE missions for $15 a pack. Apparently, they're not even worth the $15 at all and can be completed in a couple hours. Even worse, people that have bought the Steam DLC are saying that it's not even working. Blizzard is straight up scamming people at this point... \n\nThe list of the really shitty things that Blizzard has done keeps going on and on. The way they've treated their employees, how they're literally supporting the termination of Overwatch 2's esports scene by giving teams millions of dollars if they leave, and now how they've brought the game to Steam, which anybody with a brain could foresee that this game would just be bombed with negative reviews, and nothing else. And it deservedly gets mostly negative reviews.\n\nI don't think anybody wished for this game to be this mistreated by Blizzard. I just wanted to find an alternative hero-based FPS to Team Fortress 2 that isn't left abandoned and neglected by devs to rot, but it seems like I still haven't found it. Nobody should be supporting this company at all. This game and its devs have to be the biggest gaming disappointments of 2023.",
