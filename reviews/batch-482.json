And it got ANNIHILATED. It wasn't an ancient MMO with a few thousands of players, and it didn't have private servers like some online FPS do. It was breathing, and it was ERASED FROM EXISTENCE.\n\nThis is called [i]theft[/i].\n\nAnd if you're wondering \"WhY tHe ReViEw BoMbInG\", this alone is sufficient reason. This move by Activision is [b][i]ATROCIOUS[/i][/b]. The atrocity gets its due backlash.\n\n[*] In Overwatch, you can change your hero [b]at any time[/b]. That means that the hero roster is a decisive factor in this game, You can't only be good with this or that hero. You should be good with many heroes, and you should be able to make a circumstantial pick, to boost your team and/or to counter enemy team.\n\nHero roster is [b]a tool[/b], not a decoration. By definition this means all players must have access to the same roster at all times. But in Overwatch 2, you need to unlock new characters: either by grinding WITHIN A LIMITED AMOUNT OF TIME, or by purchasing. Until you unlock that new character you are at a disadvantage.\n\nThis is called [i]P2W[/i].\n\n[*] Matchmaking in OW2 is terrible. Developers don't understand the game, thus don't understand which criticism to listen to and which to ignore. They yielded to complaints that ranked queues take too long. This used to be the case because ranked queuing matched players of equal skill level. Now matchmaking prioritizes putting as much people together ASAP while still balancing skill levels very roughly. This leads to abysmal experience. Like, unranked games tend to be more fair than ranked.\n\nThis is called [b]PUBG[/b] if I'm not wrong?\n\n[*] Standalone PvE gamemode, the entire reason for DESTROYING Overwatch 1, is cancelled. PvE missions are sold $5 per unit in packs of 3.\n\nThis is called [INSERT YOUR OBSCENITY HERE].\n\n[*] At least the new heroes in OW2 were keeping the mark. Every hero in Overwatch is so different that playing different heroes is like playing different games. Well, that was the case until Illari release.\n\nEach new hero devs release is OP initially - as it is with many (any?) other games that constantly update their roster, including League of Legends, For Honor and Smite. But devs don't understand the game and don't understand which criticism to take into account and which not to. So this time they decided to go safe with the new character, and Illari came out [i]tasteless[/i].\n\nShe's ok. She can heal and it's good for support. She has a hit-scan primary attack - like Baptiste, tertiary Mercy, scoped Ana. She also has stationary healing \"turret\", which is cool but not like super cool. And she has kind of CC ultimate, with slowing and high damage on players who not clear out of it's blast radius.\n\nShe doesn't have a distinctive feeling to her. She doesn't feel like a gameplay of her own. She is very generic support character. And this is sad. Even Soldier, a very generic DPS at his core, takes a twist with his game-changer ult and self-heal. The upside is that Illari is incredibly easy to balance, just tune her heal and damage numbers. No need to re-wire ability interactions.\n\nI'll put it this way: [b]there is no motivation to pick Illari over any other support[/b].\n\n[*] I've noticed people mentioning \"beautiful skins created by talented artists\" being put for $20 a piece. Well, not only I hate the price, but the artist and the skins too. Vast majority of skins in this game do not work with character lore. \"LeTs DrEsS mOiRa In A cArNiVaL cOsTuMe\", like that's something Moira would wear.\n\nNot that it's something other games don't do as well. But in League of Legends, out-of-caracter skills are a minority. Vast majority of that game skins work with characters. In Overwatch, it's the other way round. As long as you have some respect for the cast, you gonna wear very little skins outside of vanilla.\n\n[/olist]\n\n[h2]Is there anything good about Overwatch 2 at all?[/h2]\n\nYes. It's still Overwatch, with its unique gameplay. It's a shooter game where your brain means as much or even more than how well you land your shots. Heroes are unique in their appearances and gameplay. Characters banter all the time, commenting their abilities, eliminations, saves, comebacks, whatnot. There's a universe after all, and these characters look and feel like they inhabit the world of Overwatch.\n\nTechnically game is flawless. Netcode does its job, servers are reliable, game runs adequately, no bugs that I've witnessed on my playtime.\n\nI will also claim that [i]balance is good[/i]. Everyone complains balance is bad yet no one agrees why. This is a sign of actually not so bad balance. (And this is another example of criticism that should be ignored by developers). Everyone finds their way to superiority with this roster, different heroes work for different people.\n\nI have 115 hours in OW2 and regret not playing it before, granted that I even had purchased. It looks like days of Overwatch are numbered and I want to enjoy it while it still lasts. That's why I purchased the hateful PvE pack. Have pity on me!\n\n[h2]TL;DR[/h2]\n\nOverwatch is a game I love. Overwatch 2 is a game I can't recommend to anyone.\n\n[h2]P.S.[/h2]\nI am not French.",

It's almost as if you're voluntarily subjecting yourself to a uniquely unpleasant experience, akin to undergoing a vasectomy with a spoon without painkillers, putting your balls on a cheese grater.

It's almost as if you're voluntarily subjecting yourself to a uniquely unpleasant experience, akin to undergoing a vasectomy with a spoon without painkillers, putting your balls on a cheese grater. The question lingers: why, in the name of all that is enjoyable, would you choose to endure such torment?\nFrom the very instant you embark on your Overwatch 2 journey, you're greeted by an imposing screen displaying two unmistakable choices, both of which seem to taunt your existence - the option to venture into the gameplay or to explore and experience the true definition of Sisyphean task and enigmatic offerings of the store with prices that are true fucking crime. The gameplay experience, unfortunately, can evoke an array of less-than-optimistic emotions. It's as though a storm of frustration brews within you, and saying gamer words multiple times per second is just a reality casting a shadow over your interactions with fellow players, be they, teammates or adversaries. The delicate balance of heroes and abilities that truly doesn't exist. Speaks volumes about how much you can be bad in your job as a game developer. This game is only alive for two reasons faecal matter of players that are so connected by nostalgia for gud'ol days and porn addicts. Both groups are definitions of sad and I am sorry that your parents don't like you and that there are divorced maybe just maybe you were the cause.\n",

        "review": "He tenido la experiencia más inusual al adentrarme en un juego el cual aparentemente, pasó de ser una fantasía erotica a un videojuego interactivo en el que los personajes de repente decidieron que preferían blandir armas en lugar de tener actos lascivos.\n\n¿Recuerdan esos momentos incómodos cuando intentas mezclar dos sabores que simplemente no deberían mezclarse? Bueno, imaginen eso, pero con la evolución de un hentai en un videojuego. La transición es tan audaz que casi esperaba que los personajes rompieran la cuarta pared y preguntaran, \"¿Quién necesita diálogos y trama cuando podemos tener disparos y explosiones?\"\n\nDesde luego, este es un juego que desafía todas las normas. Me quedé perplejo al ver cómo una trama que en un inicio prometía ser algo \"diferente\", se transformó en una epopeya de héroes enfrentandose en un duelo por equipos. Es como si un chef de alta cocina decidiera tomar un paquete de fideos instantáneos y convertirlo en una obra maestra culinaria de cinco platos.\n\nLa jugabilidad en sí es tan intensa como una cata de vinos, con movimientos rápidos que mantienen tus dedos en constante movimiento (a excepción por moira). Los personajes, que alguna vez se dedicaron a actividades mucho más \"pasionales\", ahora lanzan hechizos y ataques sorprendentemente poderosos (como la ulti desbalanceada de junkrat).",

Just one more...\n\nThis. Isn't. That.\n\nBlizzard took that memory out back and shot it. Buy a $20 skin to relive the glory days in Overwatch 2™️ today! (Heroes™️ sold separately)®️\n\nThe game began a slow but steady death spiral some years ago and its debut on steam is its death throes. One last desperate attempt to squeeze a few dollars out of new fans who are too young to know about the game's past and old fans who are desperate to remember the old times.\n\nAs a member of the latter, I installed Overwatch 2 the moment it was available so that I could leave this review.\n\n\"I have been called. I must answer. Always.\"\n\nRest in peace, my most beloved friend. \nI wish it was 4 AM in 2016 again.",

(changed from 25 games to 50 to place in leaderboards)\n    [*]Unfair for new players - Each hero has different abilities, making each one unique. If one hero is meta and locked behind a paywall, there is no way to win. Blizzard thinks they can do this cause Valorant and Apex do it, but all characters in those games use the same FUCKING WEAPON that they need to buy and the abilities are not the absolute core of the game whereas in Overwatch it is. \n[/list]\n\nIn Conclusion, instead of fixing the fucking game, the last 4 years from blizzard developers consisted of: \n[list]\n    [*]Watching Hentai instead of making content for overwatch (watch on big screen in meeting room)\n    [*]Faking work report summaries \n    [*]Scamming their fans \n    [*]Sucking their own cock\n    [*]Having an exclusive cup ramen diet \n    [*]Edging - for training (instead of fucking making content)\n    [*]Cucking - for training (instead of fucking making content)\n[/list]\nwhich resulted in: \n[list]\n    [*]BMI of 99+\n    [*]IQ of <1\n    [*]Copium Addiction\n    [*]Severe Brain cell degeneration\n    [*]Lies Lies LIES\n[/list]\n\n[h1] OW2 is being carried by pr0n at the moment and it is so sad [/h1]",

That just reeks of upper management scumfuckery and should be condemned.\nThat doesn't change the fact that the actual game is very fun and is a blast to play. i understand why people are leaving negative reviews but the majority of them aren't even mentioning the game.\n\nThe cool beans - \n- Mostly a no pressure, non sweat FPS. You can play this kind of relaxed and still rack up kills and wins unlike COD where you have to be 3 inches away from you screen and crouch sliding around corners.\n- Many different characters who offer up tons of different play options so the replayability is pretty much endless.\n- Looks great and runs super smooth at 4K, the optimisation is excellent. Art direction and animation work is top notch, you can even tell that one character has a wooden leg from the animation in a first person game where you can't even see the character, that's pretty impressive. There's so many small touches which make the characters likeable and appealing.\n- Linking your Playstation/Xbox account to the Steam version let's you use any skins you already had in Overwatch 1 and carries over your stats and progress.\n\nShitty beans - \n- Very salty and toxic community.\n- Team balancing is terrible right now, so many times my team gets absolutely steamrollered and then spawn camped to death until the round ends.\n- Many disconnects from the server while joining matches.\n- The company running the game is just a tad scummy.

Мой сын недавно начал играть в Overwatch 2.\nМенее чем за неделю он уже наиграл более 50 часов.\n\nЭто было ужасно для меня, потому что мне уже было достаточно тяжело проводить время с сыном, потому что он всегда был со своими друзьями или смотрел видео на YouTube.\n\nПоэтому я решил создать аккаунт Steam, чтобы играть с сыном. Я начал играть, но это был мой первый раз, когда я играл в видеоигру с 90-х годов, поэтому я был довольно потерян. Я попросил сына о помощи, и мы вместе провели несколько часов, играя в эту игру.\n\nМне это понравилось, так как это было лучшее время, которое я провел со своим сыном с тех пор, как умерла моя жена. Игра в видеоигры напомнила мне, что во всем есть удовольствие, и это снова сблизило меня и моего сына, и теперь мы фактически проводим время вместе вне дома.",

        "review": "Before I say my opinions on this game, I am new to Overwatch and it's whole ecosystem with the launch of Overwatch 2. I touched the original game maybe twice. Once at a friends house and I launched the game one time with the two week free trial Blizzard gave out for the Overwatch 2 beta in April 2022. \n\nOver the past 10 months, I have grown very attached to this game. It is a comfort game of mine, and has brought me and friends closer. Obviously, this game is flawed. As is every other free to play game by major companies. Most of the negative reviews you will see on here are negative due to hatred towards Blizzard, and I don't blame them. Especially with the fire they've been under in recent years. From what I've heard, they destroyed the original game with the Brig update and not being focused on the community. But with Overwatch 2, I can tell the developer team genuinely cares about this game. On a few social media platforms I see developers happy with the state their game is currently in, while also being excited and overjoyed with a loving community to back them up. My point with this is try the game out for yourself. This game might shove a shop in your face, but it's genuinely fun. There's even free ways to earn cosmetics. You don't need to pay an arm and a leg for a Genji skin. \n\nThank you. -Natalie Evelyn",

        "review": "This is one of those games where people will have 2000 hours on file and then write a review about how awful it is.\n\nThis is in the same vein as Destiny 2 where the combination of extremely tight game-feel and robust progression systems will probably get you addicted as hell. Like that game, you'll either be fine with that and play it here and there over the years, or you'll burn out and hate the game.\n\nIt can still be boiled down to \"TF2 if it was modernized and streamlined, for better and often for worse.\" The time-to-kill is about the same thanks to copious healing sources and high health caps, so you'll spend most time in prolonged scraps for payloads or control points, occasionally getting decimated if you're out of position or get completely outplayed. There aren't really any instakills or hugely-damaging weapons like TF2, but the greater focus on midrange damage, very speedy characters, and high-impact MOBA-like ultimates will usually make fights last a similar amount of time.\n\nTF2 launched its matchmaking system right after Overwatch originally came out, so it's a more robust version of that. You'll stream in and out of matches quickly, and it's pretty unlikely you'll ever run into botters/cheaters. There aren't really any dedicated servers though, and the speed of matches means that you can't really goof off like you can in TF2 most of the time (which is a negative for me personally). They've got extra \"arcade\" modes that are less structured, and custom game mode tools, but they're not going to fundamentally change the gameplay like custom servers in TF2 can. What you see is what you get.\n\nInstead of new weapons, Blizzard adds 2-3 new heroes every year. Their team roles are much more strictly prescribed than the relative looseness of TF2, to where you'll stick to the role you queued into in general matchmaking. They've historically been hit-or-miss with new character balance, some have broken the game like Brigitte, where others like Ashe are otherwise fine additions. Recent heroes have been mostly the latter, usually being a little too good (Kiriko) or too low-impact (Lifeweaver) and getting small adjustments over time.\n\nMonetization is the modern Fortnite system of a battle pass with limited-time items to keep you hooked over time, and an item shop where stuff rotates in and out of availability. I find the fear-of-missing-out nature of most battle passes really annoying, with the added \"bonus\" that buying into OW2 battle passes let you skip a ton of grinding to get new heroes when they're released. creating a somewhat unfair competitive advantage for the first few weeks. Item shop prices are also hilariously disconnected from reality; people will pay $20 to play as Spider-Man in Fortnite, whereas paying the same to get a goofy skin for Reinhardt is a considerably worse value proposition.\n\nThe sequel part of it was mostly an excuse to replace the older loot box monetization, which IMO was better for being able to get everything by just playing a lot, but was controversial due to how it pushed some players towards a gambling mentality. A big reason for the 2 was that there was going to be more focus on PvE content like Destiny 2, but that got scuttled into a few seasonal PvE events because of some bad project management decisions, which made the whole sequel song and dance seem even more pointless. It's functionally just Overwatch 1 with minor gameplay changes and a more obnoxious monetization system.\n\nI had big expectations when the game originally launched all those years ago, I poured a lot of hours into it, and I still play it on and off despite the pile of dumb choices Blizzard has made with it. I'm surprised they got to the point of moving it over here after all these years knowing it'll get review-bombed at launch, but they probably know it'll even out after about a year. On the surface, it's very fun and will likely still get support for several more years, just be aware they have a habit of stepping on rakes every few months and pissing everyone off.",

Played through the beta, it was the most fun I had in ages, got the game, and played over 1k hours by then. \n\nWatching the game grow gradually was a nice experience, though at some point I lost the spark on the game. One fear I always had was from Blizz making this game F2P. \n\n\"But why? TF2 was made F2P at some point and it was great.\"\nPersonally, I felt like the reason for why I feared OW going F2P was monetization behind it's side-content, I had worries that with modern \"Live Service\" games, Overwatch would simply become a big cash grab with its content, and with the normalization of battle passes, it would certainly become yet another grindy experience. \n\n...It happened, unfortunately. \nOverwatch 2 is just a shadow of what Overwatch was. Nowadays, it's just a generic, cashgrabbing F2P games. New player? Good luck grinding several hours to unlock heroes. Long-time player? Enjoy spending several hours to unlock the newest hero (that is, unless you pay them for the ********* battlepass to ever exist), \n\nThis game isn't worth it, there are better games around, like TF2.",

        "review": "fun game. good for casual fun. i think overall for a f2p experience youll probably have some fun here. it definitely has its rough patches but overall ive enjoyed this game since it came out back in 2016 and ill probably continue to (although i didnt play at all last season). HOWEVER: although i can recommend playing the game if you need a PvP game to play for a little bit maybe with some friends, my overall opinion of overwatch 2 and the direction its going in is negative. we have been burnt a lot and in a major way since the launch of overwatch 2 (not to mention the way overwatch 1 ended/was in its last 2 years of essentially nothing). activision blizzard king is a terrible greedy company. and i mean the company, not the devs. spare the devs please, i dont think this is entirely or even mostly their fault. and while that may not sound like it applies here and like im just hating blizzard, the overall decision making on a corporate level has absolutely affected this game, whether its the live service model, the awful microtransactions, or just a lack of dedicated resources to give overwatch 2 the service it needs (mostly the PvE, yknow, the whole reason for this games existence and the death of overwatch 1). overall the devs are doing an okay job maintaining the game with content, it isnt the worst ive seen, but i think they deserve more staff and money to fully unlock this games potential. it feels as if activision has put overwatch on a backburner to focus more on games like COD, but i think overwatch (at one point, not anymore) could have been way bigger than it was if they were able to deliver more content. also, where are the missions i paid for? t4 seems very passionate and undersupplied, but theres no excuse for the dlc i paid for to not function after i pay for it. im sure itll get fixed but thats ridiculous. and before you say anything, i know. i shouldnt have even entertained the idea of buying this stuff. it was out of nothing but curiosity and i get punished like this. serves me right for giving this company money. this game is just a bunch of broken promises and dreams stitched together by a team trying to make ends meet and i feel terrible for them. i hope one day this game can be done the justice it deserves but if bobby will continue to neglect it while pumping out garbage fire money printers like diablo immortal then we wont see that.\n\nand by the way, as i said, ive owned and technically played this since 2016 (although i stopped for a few years after the game died, yknow, while they were working on this \"sequel\"). i have seen people say \"oh play the game before reviewing it\" \"oh man all these people just hate blizzard they have 15 minutes on record play the game before joining the hateful mob\" i did. most of us did. yknow, its been available for 7 years and all... im just incredibly disappointed at where this game has gone. (and i hate blizzard, but i would give this a good review if i felt the game was heading in a good direction, it isnt)",

Le 1 avait un PVE et le 2 promettait un nouveau PVE, finalement alors que le jeu brasse de l'argent en masse avec son modèle économique, histoire PVE annulé, puis missions PVE à la place.\n\n [u]En conclusion[/u]: Le 2 est juste une mise a jour, c'est [b]un bon jeu[/b] malgré ses défauts mais [b]gangrené[/b] par la société avide qui l'a engendré pour de [b]mauvaises raisons[/b]. Le 1 était mieux, vive le 1, mais il est mort et je porte son deuil avec [b]amertume[/b].\n\n[i]Je vous souhaite à tous d'agréables parties sur ce jeu ou n'importe quel autre. [/i]",
