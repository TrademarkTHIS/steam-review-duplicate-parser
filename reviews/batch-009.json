I can't support a game that traded a good system that encouraged people to play more to this terrible FTP buy my battle pass system. This game is just OW1 with some minor tweaks. The main changes of this game could have been a new gamemode in arcade but just had to be rebranded. Now we're not even getting the campaign? The main reason OW2 was being created? I just don't care anymore.",

        "review": "[h1] Over-hyped and Under-fun: Over-painful Experience [/h1]\n\nLet me start by saying that playing Overwatch felt like attending a never-ending costume party thrown by a bunch of moody teenagers who think they're saving the world, one pixelated step at a time.\n\nFirst off, the characters are so diverse that I couldn't decide if I was playing a game or watching the world's most confusing fashion show. I mean, seriously, a talking gorilla scientist with glasses? Is this a game or a failed biology experiment gone horribly wrong?\n\nAnd don't even get me started on the gameplay. It's like trying to dance on a tightrope while juggling flaming pineapples. Just when you think you're getting the hang of it, some spiky-haired ninja dude zips in, slices you up, and zips out faster than my hopes of enjoying this game. I can't count how many times I died without even knowing what hit me. It's like the game designers thought, \"Let's create a game where the key to success is having the attention span of a hyperactive squirrel.\"\n\nLet's talk about the graphics. Sure, the colors are bright and flashy, but it's like someone spilled a box of crayons all over my screen and called it \"artistic style.\" And why does everything look like it's been drenched in neon? I half expected a unicorn to prance across the screen, leaving a trail of rainbow sparkles.\n\nAnd the teamwork? Oh, don't get me started on that charade. It's like herding cats, except these cats are armed to the teeth and more interested in showboating than playing as a team. I swear, my teammates had the strategy and coordination of a group of toddlers playing soccer for the first time.\n\nBut the pièce de résistance has to be the voice chat. You're either bombarded with the sound of someone's mom yelling in the background or a 12-year-old gamer genius who thinks they're the reincarnation of Sun Tzu. It's a symphony of chaos and delusion that left me questioning the state of humanity.\n\nIn conclusion, Overwatch might be a hit among the esports crowd, but for me, it's like trying to eat a pineapple with the skin on – painful, confusing, and ultimately not worth the effort. If you're looking for a game that perfectly encapsulates the feeling of being stuck in a traffic jam during a clown parade, then Overwatch is the game for you. As for me, I'll be retreating to a world where gorillas don't wear glasses and ninjas stay in the shadows where they belong.",

We can agree that Blizzard hasn't been making the right choices for their game at all. I could see the situation of Overwatch being way worse looking at other companies like Rockstar Games and EA who don't put much content into their online games. Blizzard is making content for their game even if it's little it's still content. Even despite everything that's going on I still love the game and I'm having fun with it. I see it in a case where the company is trying to add things to their game it's just not the right approach. Yes Overwatch 2 could be better, I'm sure we all want to see it thrive because the game itself is amazing and so fun to play. But the game itself is not play to win, its mostly just cosmetics which is optional...",

He is such a failure and racist and rapist in many different ways and fields. All he can see is money, all he brings to this tragic company is greedy. He is leading this company to its doom. 50,000 more negative comments and the number keep increasing, yet blizzard has no effective response and keeps on its track of a strategy of failure. It takes Bliizzard almost a year to fix bugs and make overwatch 2 exactly like overwatch 1, it is copying and pasting, it is plagiarism!!! Also, even Jesus comes, his name is called Mcree!\n\nA big update on August 10th, which was a big pancake that blizzard drew on 2019, yet, the newly published PVE mode is still trash. Poor gaming experience and poor quality will be the first topic that I want to mention now, why so many bugs are existing? These pathetic bugs which can lead to an easy failure of a task of action. AND IT COST 15 DOLLARS! WHY DO YOU HAVE GUTS OF SETTING THE PRICE AT THIS HIGH? For PVP, especially in competitive mode, a poor algorithm of matching participants, it is always mismatching different level of skills, which is resulting a bad experience. Neither being smashed nor smashing them. Blizzard is also making characters uneven, so many bad adjustment against Mercy and etc..\n\nSecondly, where is the promised Chinese server? Blizzard said this world needs more heroes, however, what Bizzard actually did is, being a fxxking racist!! This is real discrimination against 1.4 billion innocent Chinese people! And Chinese lives matter!!! Blizzard wants more money, as greedy as it always did. They force Chinese work against their willing, they force Chinese people to work for them with no payment. They want Chinese player to send money all the way across the ocean with no valuable game as a pay back. Blizzard is breaking all the laws and regulations in both China and United States!\n\nThis is my first review, and I do not recommend this game and I left a negative comment to Bliizard, Kotick and Overwatch. I want cut his male part off of Kotick and feed fish! However, even fish said fish haven't been fed yet, fish don't need a toothpick! Get that? And how are his parents make his name sounds like private part in so many combinations? K(c)ock, t(d)ick? He is disgusting! Heroes died after all, especially after a waste of life of 7 years, a tragic waste of youth and beautiful memory.\n\nAt last! CYKA BLYAT BOBBY KOTICK.",

        "review": "I can't help but express my absolute frustration and disappointment with what Blizzard Entertainment has done to Overwatch 2. It's beyond comprehension how they've managed to take a game that was once brimming with potential and turned it into an utter train wreck. This game is a shell of it's former self, Overwatch was once renounced for it's greatness inside and outside the community, now has unfortunately become another AAA company who makes a fool of themselves to their own community by disregarding any promises they made to said community for microtransactions. There is nothing I can say about this game after what they have done to the players of Overwatch 1. The devs at Blizzard Entertainment promised us that Overwatch 2 would have a spectacular PvE experience that we could enjoy day in and day out, however they never came through and now charge $14.99 for a fraction of the experience they promised us. You guys also removed lootboxes just so you could do what any other company does nowadays, charge upwards of $20 for a single skin. Your company has a multitude of issues that stems from a lack of understanding what your game truly meant and what a sequel truly meant to those who played Overwatch 1, and it baffles me that you guys can proudly push out the least amount of content possible for a company and expect us not to have any form of resent and disgust. The community is dead, and everyone who quit like myself have only downloaded this on Steam was to leave a poor review so you guys could FINALLY hear our outcries. This company and game is a shell of what it used to be, and it saddens me that anyone at Blizzard Entertainment Studios dares to release anymore content for this game. The only reason people have continued playing it is because of nostalgia for what it used to be or because they never played the original and don't understand what the devs have done to their own community. As someone who has played since near the release of Overwatch 1 and was excited for Overwatch 2's release, even recommending it to friends of mine who didn't play the original or had but didn't have time in the past, I'm truly disappointed with how far your company reaches in order to make a quick buck through as many microtransactions as Destiny 2 has, and that game has WAAAY more content. It hurts my heart to write a review like this to a game I honestly really love, but is wholeheartedly deserved for what you have done to us in the community. Myself and hundreds of thousands of people will never forgive you for ruining what we loved for your own selfish gain. And to those of whom who are just starting to play and have found themselves in love with the universe of Overwatch, stop while you still can. The lack of communication, the dismissal of feedback, and the sheer arrogance with which Blizzard has approached this sequel is truly mind-boggling. It's as if they believe they can do no wrong and that we'll blindly follow them no matter how they treat us. It's a shame to witness a franchise with such promise be squandered in such a spectacular fashion. Blizzard Entertainment should be ashamed of what they've done to the fans of Overwatch 1.",

So they decided to make Overwatch 2 but promote it that will include a full PVE Story Mode and content to justify it.\n\nAnd now we are not even getting the full PVE Story Mode and a very bare bones watered down version of it. And they decided that needed to have a $15 price tag for it too. So the very reason why this game exists is pretty much gone and we are left with a game that has a lack of content again......\n\nThey should of never made Overwatch 2 and kept improving and adding content with the original Overwatch.",

        "review": "I've been a devoted OW player since 2019, and to be honest, I don't find the changes in OW2 to be too bothersome. The gameplay's the same, and the heroes are as iconic and funny as ever. The Invasion update added a whole lot more story and lore to the game, something I think the previous game lacked a little.\n\nNow, I'm not implying that OW2 is a FLAWLESS game. There are, of course, the many paywalls to consider, and the Battle Pass Progression system to unlock new heroes is a little annoying. HOWEVER, just because this is true DOES NOT mean OW2 is the single worst game in the world and on Steam. To be brutally honest, the hate against OW2 on Steam is ridiculous. Of course, I wholeheartedly respect other players' opinions, but THERE IS a difference between having an opinion and being one-sided. I mean, most of the over 50,000 “reviewers” have only 0.5 to 2 hours logged into this game and have already railed against it. In contrast, I have nearly 400 hours logged into OW, though Steam says I only have nearly 2. \n\nThe point I’m making is this: OW2, despite what the reviewers are saying, is NOT a terrible game. Flawed, yes of course. All games have flaws. But terrible? Absolutely not. Paywalls and Battle Pass aside, this game is very enjoyable, and I urge these people review-bombing this game to just give it a chance. The Battle pass rewards are mostly cosmetic and do not directly alter gameplay, save for visuals. A fun game like OW2 does not deserve the sheer amount of hate it’s receiving right now. Are there things Blizzard does that I don’t agree with? Yes. The cash-grabs can be a big nuisance. But in the end, OW2 is still an enjoyable game. The original 6-year old Overwatch didn’t “die” when it became OW2. Instead, it only received a much needed upgrade. And through all those changes and updates, Overwatch is still the same engaging hero-based shooter it has been for nearly 7 years. I just don’t understand why so many people are hating against this game without giving it a proper chance.\n\nOW2 Rating: 8.50/10.\nGame has some issues, but is still enjoyable and fun to play.\n\n\n",

Что на счет PVE? Оно вышло неплохим, но довольно коротким, но это примерно то что я ожидал увидеть, раскрытие личностей персонажей, их отношений, теперь это больше чем пара фраз перед началом матча. Я не буду говорить много о том что в PVE отменили, уже каждый это обмусолил, просто хочу сказать что близзард наступили на те же грабли, надеюсь хоть в  этот раз они чему-то научатся.Тем кто так яростно и резко высказываются об игре искренне прошу не портить своим язвительным мнением что игра ужасная другим игрокам, особенно тем кто еще собирается ознакомиться с этой вселенной, ведь они многое потеряют.\nЧтож всем сердцем надеюсь что дальше игра будет становится лучше в  будущем, вам советую думать в менее негативном ключе и своей головой, играйте, стройте свое мнение, наслаждайтесь",

        "review": "Dogshit Dev team that's too scared to stand by their vision and original intent for players. They wanted it to be counter pick and demand swapping but bitched out of it, created Brig to control the meta (xdd) which broke this game's competitive scene and balance permanently, and then they fucked off for 3 years to do PvE only to cancel it and hobble out this dogshit piss pit of a product 3 years too late. \n\nI truly wish for this game to rot in irrelevancy and cripple Activion Blizzard's disgusting business practices.\n\nContext: got game in Lunar Year, of 2017, clocked 1k hours abouts on Customs with the updated Browser and more in 2 years; dropped out around Brig and Goats, watched OWL Inaugural and Year 1, and that Anubis clip of the fans booing Houston Outlaws swapping back to goats lives rent free in my head. \nFuck this game :D",
