ПВЕ поднимут и будут держать, нытики ничего не смогут сделать. Сейчас главное не бухтеть.\n\nОт нас требуется сидеть тихо. После того, как все сделают, все будет у нас хорошо. Всем устроят довольствие, как Фортнайтовским гражданам - каждый будет кататься в масле. Главное сейчас сидеть тихо и не суетиться. Никаких ревьюбомбингов, никаких отмен игры. Просто переждать и всё будет хорошо, там все схвачено.\n\nПросто надо перетерпеть застой и все наладится, братка. Не надо негативить и выходить в обзоры. Отсиди свой срок в квикосах или просто расслабься, отдохни, накати аркадку, БП купи в конце концов. Цельные игры за разовый прайс также являются тиранией, тиранией более тщательно замаскированной, но в сущности не дарующий свободы.\n\nРебята, не кипишуйте! Сидите тихо, сейчас такой момент, нужно переждать!\nПросто завяжите узелком свои хотелки, не время предъявлять претензии разработчикам. Поверьте, там все знают лучше вас, там люди, управляющие игрой уже давно, а не вчерашние школьники. Они понимают, что делают. Горят фанаты - значит должны гореть, начали внезапно раздавать старые скины - значит так нужно. Сейчас очень напряженный момент, некоторые много ходовые анонсы в критически важной стадии! Враги и конкуренты все это уже поняли, и сейчас контент может релизнуться в любом месте, в любой момент.\nНеобходимо сплотиться и не реагировать на провокации! За вас все сделают те, кто сверху, не беспокойтесь! И вы не узнаете Овервотч, все зацветет!\nГлавное - потерпеть!",

Millions of players, this was their first introduction to an fps. The game required noone to play a character that could aim. It was a wonderful bonding experience as well and the community was extremely wholesome.\n\nHeres where we get to Overwatch \"2\" if you can even call it that. It's more like Overwatch 1.5\nBlizzard has become a money hungry, battle pass, pay 25 dollars for a skin mess. The whole reasoning for Overwatch 2 was that it was going to have a story mode. The story mode was completely scrapped and replaced by \"story missions\". 3 years, it was THREE YEARS of no content for the first Overwatch with the promise of something greater.\n\nThe company that was well respected, Blizzard, is gone. Activision Blizzard, is now known for sexual harassment, silencing players for the free Hong Kong movement, unfinished games, and micro transactions.\n\nI miss Blizzard. I miss Overwatch. I still love the characters, but I cannot recommend this game to anyone.",

Allen Brack as Executive Producer and Vice President of World of Warcraft.\n- Being LGTV+ and pushing agenda in their games.\n- \"Don't you guys have phones?\" Answer to enraged customers, releasing one of the most predatory mobile games ever.\n- Being fucking creeps in general.\n- \"Writing\" Sylvanas Windrunner.\n- Heavily underpaying employees.\n- Trying to get those sweet Environmental, Social, and Governance (EGS) points.\n- Setting up shop in Commiefornia.\n- The Absolute Travesty that is Warcraft III Refunded.\n- Destroying and automating their GM process.\n- Fucking up SC2's story.\n- Hiring snowflakes as Forum Mods.\n- Fucking up Warcraft's story/lore.\n- Cancelled Souls-like Diablo 4.\n- Tried to cancel their own Overwatch character Jesse McCree.\n- Cancelled Battlefield-like Starcraft FPS.\n- Pushing LGTV+ to children, being the pedos that they are, no surprise there.\n- Crawling to Steam to search for more Simp-Whales.\n- Banning Nickmercs. \n- Sexually Harassing an employee to the point of un-aliving herself.\n- Using COD as a platform for BLM/Antifa, and any other 'Current Thing(tm)'.\netc, etc, etc.[/b]\n\nActivision-Blizzard has to be one of the worst if not The Absolute Worst video game companies ever. \nFestering in the sacrificed corpse of the Original Blizzard Entertaiment upon the altar of the absolute devil of the video game industry going by the name of Bobby Kotick. \nAll actively defended by an army of Shills, Simp-Whales, Blizztubers, LGTVs, Professional Astroturfers, Creeps, Urinalists, Gambling Addicts, Cheaters/Botters and Twitch/YT/OF Thots.\n\nAlso. [b]Arcturus Mengsk[/b] called. He said that you can have all of his nukes for Free.\n\n##|\\**/|###########################################################\n##\\==/###########################################################\n##|__|###########################################################\n##|__|###########################################################\n##\\._./###########################################################\n###\\/############################################################\n#############|\\**/|################################################\n#############\\==/################################################\n#############|__|################################################\n#############|__|################################################\n#############\\._./################################################\n##############\\/#################################################\n##########################|\\**/|###################################\n##########################\\==/###################################\n##########################|__|###################################\n##########################|__|###################################\n##########################\\._./###################################\n###########################\\/####################################\n################################################################\n###############_______##########################################\n##########___ /_(__(_)__)\\____#####################################\n#########/(.(_(_)________))__)_)\\###################################\n########((___(_)(__)_)_______(__))##################################\n######((/_( _(__)__(___).).( ____).)_)##################################\n######(_(_(_(_)__((__(______)_((_ )_))################################\n######(_(_)__(_(__)__)_______).._)(_)################################\n#####(_(__(_(_).(____( _ ) ).____).)_)_(################################\n#####(.(_(__).(__)_(_))_((___).._ )(__)_)################################\n#####(.(_(.\\.).(__(_._(___)__(.).).).)_)).(.)################################\n#####(_(__(_(__(_(.)__(.___)_).(_)_)__)################################\n#####(.(_(.(_(_)__.(__)_).).__)_)._(.(__)################################\n#####((_(___)(___(____)__) _(_.(_(_.)#################################\n######(_((__(_(__((.(.(.|..).).).)__))..._)##################################\n#######((__)____\\\\||lll|l||///_____\\_))###################################\n############(_./(/.(_)_).)\\__)########################################\n###########(__(.(.(.|.|.).).)\\__.)#######################################\n############(_/(|./.(.)).).).))_)########################################\n##########(___( ((((_(|)_)))))__)######################################\n############(___||\\(|(|)|/||__)########################################\n###########(____|(||(||)||||____)######################################\n############(___//|/l|||)|\\\\.\\__)#######################################\n###########(/././/_/|//||||\\\\_ \\..\\ _)######################################",

        "review": "Overwatch is the greatest first-person shooter ever made, and my all time favorite game. Before I get into in my review I'll preface my review by letting the reader know that there is basically a review bombing campaign against the game, and while I never agree with review bombing, I understand the anger of the fanbase when it comes to their intentions by giving the game a negative review. I still strongly disagree with review bombing as a practice as reviews should be about the game itself, and not the drama or monetization practices within it (especially when those monetization practices don't affect gameplay in anyway). \n\nI'm going to split my review into multiple segments so you can better understand the various aspects of the game. I'll start first with monetization.\n\n[h1] Monetization [/h1]\n\nWhenever a video game has microtransactions there are always going to be naysayers and skeptical players, and rightfully so as greedy, money-hungry developers do everything in their power to part players from their money. Overwatch 1 had extremely fair monetization in the form of lootboxes. Overwatch was a paid game that cost below the industry standard at $40, with a more expensive \"Legendary\" version with bonus skins included at $60. Throughout the year Overwatch would host six seasonal events. These events were Lunar New Year, Overwatch Archives, Anniversary, Summer Games, Halloween Terror, and Winter Wonderland. With each of these events there was a new Arcade game mode introduced with lighthearted gameplay to pull you away from the main game. Along with these events came time-limited lootboxes with various cosmetics for each character, these included skins, highlight intros, emotes, victory poses, voicelines, sprays and player icons. Overwatch 2 has since added player titles, name cards, souvenirs, and weapon charms. At the time people thought that lootboxes were predatory, and at the time I disagreed. If you played the game enough, you could easily get the event items. You could purchase one lootbox for $1 dollar, or a larger amount for a discounted price. Each lootbox would have 4 items, and during the three week-long event you would earn event-themed lootbox. Every event lootbox would have at least one event item. This mechanic did NOT work well during the first year of Overwatch considering that there would be duplicate items in each lootbox. One year into Overwatch's lifespan they got rid of duplicate items in lootboxes, unless no more items of a certain rarity were available to earn. If you received a duplicate item you earned currency based on the rarity of the item. Each lootbox had at least 1 \"rare\" item.  [url=https://i.imgur.com/1HSjtRR.png]You can see the break down of the currency values with this chart.[/url] So this lootbox system was an incredibly easy to earn mechanic, and all items could be earned in game except for special skins like the annual Blizzcon event skin ($40-$50) or Overwatch League skins which require you to watch YouTube to farm the currency. \n\nSo this lootbox mechanic was the primary way to earn items in Overwatch 1, and it lasted from 2016 until 2022. It was an insanely fair mechanic that had its detractors, but it honestly worked. If you played the game you could easily earn the time-limited event items. The quickest way to do this would be to earn all of the default non-event cosmetics so that your event lootboxes wouldn't have a chance to give those default items. It took a bit of time to earn all of the items in the default pool, but it was honestly doable since there were a considerable more amount of event items.  That's how this mechanic functioned.\n\nSo Overwatch 2 comes out in Early Access in October 2022 as a Free-To-Play game with extremely predatory practices in terms of earning cosmetics. I'll start with what is NOT a predatory practice, in my mind. Each season has a Battlepass that last 60 days. These Battlepasses contain 9 skins, with some cosmetics of every type. Introduced with the Battlepass system is a new rarity of skin called \"Mythic\" that allows you to customize the Mythic skin to your liking, with a lot of variance. This is an AMAZING value at $10. Where they lose me a bit is that there are premium Battlepass bundles that contain exclusive skins not found anywhere else, and these can be pretty pricey at $30-$40 (I think the $40 Battlepass is exclusive to Season 6 which includes PvE missions, so I assume the price will return to $30). These bundles are simply expensive, especially if the player is spending $30-$40 every 2 months. Regardless of this premium Battlepass bundle, at $10 the Battlepass system is fun, and a steal. Now this is where Blizzard shows their disgusting greed. Each season has a theme, like Season 1's Cyberpunk theme for example. There is a cosmetic store that will rotate weekly store exclusive skins at a VERY high price. Each one of these store skins can cost up to $20, but have been cheaper when bundled, although that isn't entirely common. Recently there has been a bundle of Season 1 skins that were DRASTICALLY cheaper than each skin's individual price, but still a little bit pricey, and that's with the bundled discount that many games with a microtransaction store have. This is simply unacceptable as the once earnable skins are now locked behind a store...but it gets worse. The skins that you could earn from lootboxes for free are also now locked behind a paywall as well in the premium store. This is and was a disaster but there have been mild attempts from Blizzard to walk it back. Starting with Season 3 each Battlepass gives 1,500 Overwatch 1 Credits for use on Overwatch 1 cosmetics. This is a really small amount, and not really feasible for players who would want to earn mutliple years-old cosmetics from Overwatch 1. They have effectively made all skins only earnable from the new paid currency \"Overwatch Coins\". Players who earned Credits from lootboxes during their time playing Overwatch 1 can still spend that currency, but can't use it on items that cost \"Overwatch Coins\". I know that's a bit confusing, but the long haul of it is that Blizzard is making older skins inaccessible to newer players. This is the reason a great game has been review bombed, and there's a part of me that understands that. The economy for this game is out of whack, and it really bothers me that they're essentially locking off a way to earn items outside of smaller events that give usually an \"Epic\" rarity skin, or the Battlepass. You can also do weekly challenges that during the course of a 2-month long season give about 540 Overwatch Coins. These weekly missions require a fair amount of gameplay, and progress your Battlepass levels...but here's the kicker. Doing all of these nets about 540 Overwatch Coins, but skins can cost upwards of 2,200 Overwatch Coins...so you don't even have enough to cover a Battlepass purchase of 1,000 Overwatch Coins. I'm not really sure how else I can explain this disaster of monetization, but hey there it is. All of these practices do not involve the gameplay, but it's still a really big bummer and bane to gamers that once loved playing Overwatch, especially in the golden era of unlocks being 2016-2022.\n\n[h1] Gameplay [/h1]\n\n\n\nreview in progress",

Although I find this a fun game, the Steam release is filled with bugs that make things a little weird.\nFor example: On this version, according to my history, it claims that I abandoned all of my matches. I abandoned none of them.\nAnother example: On this version, in the endorsements, it thinks everyone in the match is on the enemy team. \n\nWhile I don't recommend the Steam Version at the moment, the BattleNet one should be fine.\n\nWill possibly edit this in the future,\n\nAugust 10th, 2020 8:10 PM EDT",

LOL! they would never do that!",

On top of it all you have to buy their scam system of coins.  There are very few things you can buy for straight real money. You have to buy coins first, and with that you can't purchase the exact amount of coins you need to buy something.\n\nIf prices were more reasonable, put the individual skins in the store, and did away with coins, I would give the game a positive review.",
