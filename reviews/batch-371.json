        "review": "I can't in the right mind recommend anyone play or even try Overwatch 2.\n\nThe sole reason that Blizzard released a second game and advertised the game around -- the PvE with progression systems to provide replay value -- was ultimately scrapped. Sure, they eventually released some missions, but it seems like it will be a pay-as-you-go system for missions likely of questionable quality given how the game has been handled so far. This left us with a poorly balanced husk of a game, released only to enforce a new monetization scheme that is so predatory and unfair to players' time that players ended up preferring the previous system of loot boxes.\n\nThe claim that the new game brought a \"new look\" with a \"new engine\" are entirely false; Overwatch 1 was removed from BattleNET store to hide that Overwatch 2 is the exact same game, on the exact same engine; so much so that for multiple weeks after it's release, it was recognized by SEVERAL applications e.g. Windows Control Panel, NVidia GEForce Experience, and Discord as the exact same game as Overwatch 1. The inclusion of changing environmental settings within maps and claiming it's in any way new technology is laughable; Garry's Mod has had entities to change the position of the sun in the skybox, alongside sky and fog design, which would also dynamically change the maps' lighting -- since before Overwatch 1's original TEASER TRAILER RELEASED. A forum post of players asking how to use these dates back to February 2 of 2014 -- the teaser was November 7.\n\nUnlocking the shiny new heroes is locked behind a battle pass, deep enough in that it could take a couple weeks to unlock them. Alternatively cough up $10 and receive a single hero immediately. In the case of multiple heroes released such as Junker Queen, Sojourn, and Kiriko -- who have all been essential picks since their inception, topping pick rates in most elo ratings (especially higher) due to the versatility and power of their kit -- this means you either spend weeks lulling behind other players or choking up the $10 per character to be able to play the competitive mode viably.\n\nEven if you don't care for the competitive modes, the almost non-existent gameplay style gap between the competitive mode and all other gamemodes -- including any of the modes in Arcade -- results in all casual modes eventually becoming filled with players who want to play to win but are either unhappy with their performance in the competitive mode or want to avoid the stigma behind it, often making even casual play a toxic slog.\n\nThere are no deeper mechanics to learn aside from aim and gamesense, which all first person shooters demand regardless. Even the most difficult heroes have kits that can easily be described in a couple sentences per ability maximum. The most intricate details possible are specific interactions between various abilities -- but those aren't mechanics to improve your skill upon, those are knowledge checks that are one-and-done, easily learnable and digestible within seconds.\n\n--\nContrast this with FOUR similar games (2 FPS and 2 traditional MOBAs):\n\nFPS:\nPaladins:\n- Has deeper mechanics to tinker and learn with talents, card decks, and progressive item purchases within matches\n- Competitive mode doesn't allow players to swap character mid-match, making character picks more meaningful\n- Competitive mode also features a ban phase commonly found in literally all other competitively viable games\n\nTeam Fortress 2:\n- Has deeper mechanics to practice and master with blast jumping, surfing, and air strafing\n- Bustling community scene with a functional server browser and well-documented modding tools\n- Community-supported competitive scene is still alive and well to this day\n\nTraditional MOBAs:\n- Items, progressive power increase, strategic downtime, macro play\n- Competitive and casual modes feature ban phases\n- Characters are locked past pick phase\n\nDOTA 2:\n- All characters are free! Wow! Crazy!\n- Powerful items allow clever purchases to turn the tide of a bad game\n- Mostly unit-cast abilities and items makes effective ranges consistent to play around and more fair\n- Slow pace shifts focus more towards macro (gamesense and strategy) play\n\nLeague of Legends:\n- Massive roster supports a wide range of playstyles\n- Runes, summoner spells, items, and interactions all within grants tinkering power\n- Mostly missile-based abilities grants skill expression through the pushing of character limits\n- Fast pace shifts focus more towards micro (mechanics and execution) play\n\nAnd would you believe, all of these games are free too?\nDon't waste your disk space or time, Overwatch 2 doesn't respect it.",

        "review": "Más que recomendar el juego, lo que recomiendo es PROBARLO, por que por muy raro que suene, de verdad que este juego no es para todos. Si soportas este juego eres un desequilibrado mental, ya sea por que ya lo eras cuando lo empezaste a jugarlo, o el juego te convirtió en eso.\n\nAntes que nada, aclarar que tengo 350+ Horas en Battle.net, como 30 en Nintendo Switch y como 15 en PS4, asi que pueden inferir que me gusta el juego y por ende no tengo derechos humanos.\n\nEl juego como tal es bastante solido. Un muy buen juego arruinado por la avaricia y la incompetencia de quienes están detrás de el.\n\nEl juego no es ni Pay 2 Win , como usuario gratuito puedes disfrutar del juego casi que en toda su totalidad (solía ser en su totalidad, pero 15 bolas por 3 misiones de historia cambia las cosas, que genio que sos Blizzard). Eso si, el juego si se esfuerza en dejarte en claro, de forma muy descarada, todo lo que te pierdes si no pagas 3 riñones, pero si quieres simplemente vivir el entorno PvP y competitivo pues tecnicamente nada te detiene, aparte de tener que desbloquear los personajes. Los personajes pueden ser comprados o desbloqueados jugando (algunos ya vienen desbloqueados obvio), lo cual puede ser una molestia por que muchos personajes se hacen counter entre si, y puede suceder que muchas veces la estrategia más optima sea usar un personaje que no tienes, ni mucho menos controlas. Entre eso y que a nivel de jugabilidad es muy variado y se llega a alejar bastante de otros First Person Shooters, es normal que tus primeras horas en este juego sean más frustrantes que divertidas, pero creo que ironicamente es lo que demuestra si el juego es o no para ti. Esa frustración no se va a ir nunca, a veces tu equipo es una mierda y no puedes hacer nada al respecto, a veces ideas una estrategia solida con tu ulti solo para que una habilidad defensiva cualquiera te arruine los planes, a veces todo juega en contra de ti. Los que jugamos y amamos este juego lo hacemos pese a eso (para algunos enfermitos es justamente por eso). \n\nTodo esto, sin hablar de la multitud de problemas que tiene el juego y que definitivamente no son parte de como fue diseñado, pero eso es algo con lo que la comunidad pelea constantemente, y si decides unirte a ella ya decidiras si romperte la cabeza con cada mala decisión de Blizzard o encogerte de hombros, pensar \"it is what it is\" y jugar mientras tu alma llora por todo lo que el juego puede ser y no es por que los de Blizzard son tremendos tragap1jas.\n\nSi, quisiera que el juego fuera más divertido y accesible, y menos frustrante y descarado, y sepa judas si eso pasará algún dia, y si hoy juegas a esto y lo primero que piensas es que el juego es una mierda, lo comprendo perfectamente.\n\nPero es gratis. Pruebalo, mira si tienes la tolerancia para soportar que te chupe el alma, y si te gusta, pues bienvenido al quinto circulo del infierno. Si no te gusta, vienes a insultar a los idiotas blizzard como todos y no pierdes nada. Bueno, un pedazo de vida quizá, pero tu y yo sabemos que si te planteaste tan siquiera descargar este juego, entonces no ibas a hacer nada de provecho con ese tiempo de todas maneras",

You can tell that the development, animation, and art team really do love this game and its universe. Its just super unlucky that executives at Blizzard do not care about the players and only want money. I do still recommend playing Overwatch even if the monetization is bad. If you don't want to buy stuff or don't like the skin prices than dont give Blizzard your money. Overwatch can feel extremely rewarding and be so fun with a group of friends.

OW2 promised a bunch of PVE content, but they knew it wasn't coming out BEFORE OW2 even went live and decided not to tell anyone. They lied to their player base, haven't fixed matchmaking, have mostly overpriced skins in the store, the \"PVE\" content they've just released is just a very minor upgrade to a feature that was removed from OW1, but now you have to pay for it. Don't give them your money, go buy Baldur's Gate 3 and give Larian Studios some love instead, They actually care about their players and have released a quality product.",

Maybe it'll be fun again one day, but from the looks of it, this is going to stay a quick live service cash grab.\n",

I stopped playing League of Legends and Dota for you, and I surely loved you more than Blizzard ever did. Unfortunately, Overwatch \"2\" is not the giant upgrade that was promised but a slight remaster with some new characters and maps. Sure you can play it for free, but loads of the content is locked behind battle passes or other pay walls. I downloaded it to reminisce about the good times I once had, and got a ton of achievements for it, so I guess there's that.",

        "review": "Edited my review to put this quick summary at the top:\nOverwatch 2 is not a game without faults. I think a player should evaluate what's important to them and decide themselves if they like the game and wish to spend time with it, like anything else they do in their life. In my opinion, the actual gameplay in Overwatch 2 today is the most fun the franchise has been in a very long time. The game is free, and all Heroes and maps are playable without spending any money. If you are picking up the game today, know that the game is best experienced with friends.\n----\nPrefacing this by saying I, personally, never really cared about the PvE campaign. I was probably going to play it at some point, but what I mostly play the game for is the PvP, which I find very fun, so PvE not being rolled out the way it was promised has no impact on my opinion of the game we have today. It's very important to note that, for a very large number of people, the promises were make or break situation the game. I acknowledge that this is a legitimate reason to dislike the game. There is still a PvE campaign-ish thing in the game as of Season 6, it just simply is not what people expected. Final side note on this, the PvE was always planned and advertised as a paid experience, I am not sure how people ended up thinking it was going to be free.\n\nThe handling of the professional Overwatch scene was very poor and also impacts a lot of people's opinion of the game. Overwatch can be a difficult game to watch, so combining that with bad management, is unfortunate (but also has no bearing on the actual gameplay). I wish Blizzard had let the grassroots competitive scene grow naturally, instead of creating the mess of OWL.\n---\nI am a peak Masters player in standard competitive, so I have an OK idea of the game state, but I'm not a particularly amazing player, especially because I just play ranked occasionally now and squat in Gold and Platinum depending on role (washed up).\n-\nOverwatch is a fun and colorful hero shooter in an interesting futuristic universe with goofy likeable characters that allows for a lot of skill expression for people with different play styles and skill sets. Team fights are dynamic, chaotic, fun, and frequent - nearly constant. The average time-to-kill in this game is quite long compared to traditional shooters, which is my personal preference. Every role has significant impact on the outcome of the game, however, not every Hero has the capability to win the game on their own.\n\nI particularly like the amount of characters with high mobility options in the game, which is a deterrent for some people due to the increased emphasis on mechanical skill, I just find it fun! There are Heroes that don't require good aim and there are Heroes that don't require fast reflexes and keypresses. Most important, currently every Hero in the game is a viable option - despite what your teammates may say (But team play is still more important than Hero viability). There are mains for every hero in Top 500 in every region, which somewhat, imperfectly, proves my point.\n\nThe transition to becoming a F2P Live Service game was a good move overall, in my opinion. The additional cash flow should incentivize more frequent updates and balance changes, and so far has done exactly that.\nThe price point for skins is in line with other F2P games, which means they are quite expensive. The seasonal battlepasses have improved and are now about average, or slightly below, compared to other games in terms of content. There is a ton of filler that no one wants, but the large milestone premium rewards are pretty cool, which seems standard. For comparing, Fortnite still stands above most of the industry.\nA complaint I have with the new economy is that the seasonal battlepasses so far have not had currency in them to pay for future battlepasses, which is a practice many games with passes have. Placing Heroes in the battlepass, also, was a move I, and many others, did not like. Note, they are on the free pass, rather than the paid pass, and all of the Heroes are available through free missions after their debut season has passed.\nThere are weekly quests for battlepass experience that also have a premium currency reward for their completion, but the amount you earn is so minuscule it might as well not be there. What is most important about the change to a F2P environment, is that every map and every Hero is available to a brand new player without spending any money whatsoever.\n\nTo extend on this thought though, I think that with how this game is played, all Heroes should be immediately unlocked for all players after their onboarding because of the importance of Hero swapping. A player starting the game today is at a legitimate disadvantage because of their limited Hero pool, until they finish unlocking them all. If the game were even more MOBA-like and did not have Hero swapping (like Paladins) then this system could be slightly more acceptable. As it stands, in my opinion, this is the biggest reason to not pick up the game if you don't plan to play long term. It is not P2W, but it certainly is not a direction I like, despite it not affecting me personally.\n\nThe online community for this game, both inside of the game and out of it, is like every other online game - extremely toxic. There are bubbles of pleasant and nice people, but you usually have to seek them out.  I met my closest IRL friends in a random match of this game, so I know there are nice people who play the game. My recommendation, unfortunately, unless you are high rank and playing Competitive, is to not join voice chat and disable text chat if you have a sensitive disposition.On the plus side, I report people constantly, and constantly receive notifications that the people I reported have been actioned on. Press the button liberally.\n-\nOther things about the game:\nThe Workshop is a powerful tool that has a dedicated community of players and creators keeping it fun and interesting. There are tons of fan-created modes and tons of people playing.\n\nThe Arcade is quite fun and silly (depending on rotation), but is unfortunately not incredibly popular. Sometimes, a particularly fun mode rolls through and has extremely fast queues. Mystery Heroes and Deathmatch are other alternative ways to play the game, which I find relaxing, especially compared to Competitive. Ever since Blizzard nerfed Tanks in non-role-lock queues, these modes have been much more enjoyable.\n\nThe Achievement system in this game is a particular soft spot for me. I am a completionist and love achievement hunting. This game is actually quite good for people like me. A downside, is many achievements are only available during specific seasonal events, so you may have to wait a long time for them if you are starting today. Tangentially related, there are Co-op event modes with scoring and leaderboards that are really fun to optimize with friends.\n\nCompetitive is the central (but not most popular) mode in the game. In my opinion, there is not enough incentive to try to climb the ranked ladder, unless you are aiming to go pro. I own many golden guns, and what I gain out of Competitive is just more golden guns. Needs improvement. The temporary Competitive modes that Blizzard comes up with (like Mystery Heroes and Lúcioball) are always super fun to me, but have very long queues due to being unpopular.\n\nLast thing I can think of is Co-op Vs AI matches. I have no experience here, but, like in LoL, apparently the mode is quite popular. Could be a nice alternative if playing against people is stressful.\n--\nConclusion: There is definitely good and bad that you need to weigh yourself. For me, I really like this game, I find it very fun, so I will continue to play. My opinion, whether you're new or experienced, is the best way to enjoy this game, coming from a former competitive-only player, is grab a beer, get a group of friends together, queue Quick Play/Arcade/Workshop, and just goof around.",
