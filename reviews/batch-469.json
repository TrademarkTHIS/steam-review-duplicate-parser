        "review": "\n\nI miss Overwatch 1\n\n\nOverwatch 2 was created to make way for the free PvE mode, and with that Overwatch 1 servers were shut down. But back in May they announced that the PvE was getting canceled and so there was no point in even making an OW2, but later announce that they will be doing PAID PvE mission every event which will include THREE whole mission for $15. \n\nThe Overwatch team got a bunch of backlash for this from a lot of people but not everyone. Why?\n\nBecause the Overwatch community is trash and will just eat anything that Blizzard will throw at them.\n\nThe cycle goes like this \"Blizzard does some dumb shit and the community cries about it, then blizzard shows off something shiny in front of them (new hero or skin) and the community go back to being obedient. Talking about skins, they have a theme for battlepasses and most of the time a lot of the skins aren't even centered around the theme and are instead put in the shop for $20 or more depending if it's a bundle, and the community eats it right out of the dog bowl Blizzard put that skin in. I don't have problems with battlepass when done right, for example Fortnite, you pay 900 vbucks to buy it and within the battlepass there are 1500 so you are able to buy the next bp plus a little extra, on the other hand, Overwatch has ZERO paid currency and instead adds an old currency we used back in OW1 to buy old skins.\n\nDon't get me wrong though, the games loads of fun when the matchmaking works right in putting you in a balanced team, the heroes and their kits are top notch even though they aren't really well balanced most of the time. So not really saying to not play the game, but try not to support their scummy microtransactions or they will continue to fuck you over.",

A go to if we didn’t think of anything else. We had a blast almost every time. \n\nSadly, Overwatch 2 is not that game. For starters, they boiled the game down to have even less features. No “On Fire” system at launch, less players on a team, NOT EVEN LOOT BOXES! Something is wrong with the world when a gamer wants loot boxes back! \n\nThis free to play model is clearly just a cash grab. But they promised a brand new PVE mode with the addition of the 2 in the title. Recently, they revealed that the decision to cancel what was promised in hopes of delivering a better multiplayer experience. And of course, add some of the promised features behind a paywall. \n\nThis coupled with quite a few controversies Blizzard/ Activision has made Overwatch 2 wildly unpopular. They thought they were doing a smart thing by bringing it to steam, but let’s collectively show them it won’t be worth it. \n\nThey’re desperate to make this work. And we’re desperate for a good game. Overwatch 2 will never be that game. Don’t support them!",

        "review": "I really enjoy Overwatch: the unique playstyle of heroes and the team dynamics really make it shine. \n\nI definitely get the frustration and anger people feel about Overwatch being handled poorly. I didn't have huge expectations for the PvE (Archive Mission 2.0 seemed fine for low-cost narrative updates), but the game sets such a high bar in many respects that the potential for its continued development seemed so promising. This does seem like a pretty decent content update to keep people engaged and it really is worth giving it a chance if you haven't.\n\nI was actually pleasantly surprised that I got credit for every Overwatch achievement I'd already unlocked in the original game; the damn thing was updating three at a time for like 5 minutes. I can't remember Steam syncing achievements like this in any game. As someone who has replayed games I love with achievement hunting as a motivation, this was definitely a positive first impression, especially given all the negative feedback I'd heard so far.\n\nSome minor progress towards player icons was reset if you hadn't finished them, but the hero progress system actually does seem pretty beefy too. This type of hero progression is definitely the type of thing I had in mind in Overwatch 2.0.",

        "review": "A lot of negative reviews here already and one would think oh just angry nerds review bombing. No, Blizzard simply messed up big time and they continue to mess up in everything they do by letting their greed get in the way of releasing quality products\n\nBlizzard used to have a moto that if a game wasn't good enough quality they wouldn't release it and they really held true to that moto all the way through to StarCraft 2 and some of the WoW expansions. But now their moto is how much microtransactions can we put in our new game and how can we screw over our customers in the best way possible\n\nWell a good way to achieve that is by deleting an old game; Overwatch 1 that people paid for, had in-game currency on and such and then wiping it completely with what may be called \"Overwatch 2\" but in actuality is just a version 1.5 store overhaul for Overwatch 1\n\nAt its core not all that much has been changed in Overwatch itself and most of the changes they have done have been really horrible. They destroyed ranked, they somehow managed to make the balance even worse and after having removed a lot of the stuns and shields from the game they now are adding new heroes back in with... wait for it.... stun and shield spam....\n\nOh and all my in-game currency I was saving up for event skins on Overwatch 1? All gone, they gave the new in-game currency equivalent for it at much less value and that new in-game currency equivalent can't even buy the same skins the old in-game currency could. No those skins are now charged at ridiculous prices. Some of the old skins in the game they are changing 30+ dollars for!!!!!!!!!!\n\nThe battlepass is over priced and low actual value, you don't get all that much out of it that is worth the price they are selling it for. The in-game store is over priced and poorly designed. You don't earn enough premium currency from playing the game nor even from the battlepass to actually get anything worthwhile on the store\n\nAnd here is the icing on the cake... The big PvE story mode that was their biggest selling point for Overwatch 2 the very thing that was meant to put the 2 into Overwatch 2.... Well that got cancelled and now instead they are releasing the equivalent of the PvE event missions that we used to have on Overwatch 1 but that is now what the PvE mode on Overwatch 2 will consist of, but that's not even the icing on the cake....\n\nThe icing on the cake is the fact that they are charging 15 bucks for the pleasure. What do you think this 15 bucks gets you? Access to the entire PvE mode? NOOOO haha you crazy! It gets you access to 3 \"story\" missions\n\nIf these story missions are anything like the free mission they let you play to sell you on the missions then they aren't even worth playing for free much less for 15 bucks!\n\nThe negative reviews here are warranted and are not review bombing, we just never had the chance to put our honest reviews on Bnet and now we finally get to have our voices heard. Though I am sure Blizzard has already heard our voices through the fact that Overwatch 2 is turning out to be a big flop\n\nYou can tell how desperate they are by the fact that they have brought it to Steam, their Bnet player counts on the game are dropping massively so what else to do but try to appeal to a larger player base but all they will find here are the many once loyal Blizzard fans who don't have phones",

Skins cost like 20+ bucks, while being 9 years old.\n\n[b]Cons: [/b]\n- We got promised a PvE mode that is huge, after keeping Overwatch 1 on no content for years, Overwatch 2 launched with nothing changed besides some minor graphics changes and big balance changes. Some of the changes even removed staples of the game like Mei with a FREEZE gun can no longer FREEZE people, only slow. Then she was banned from playing for weeks cause of a small bug they could not fix,\n\n- This game often gives you purposely malicious designed things in the shop. For example, the game has 2 currencies, the Silver one and the Gold one. Silver is old currency from OW1 that got converted and the Gold one is the premium one to buy stuff.\n\n- So they decided to put the OLD currency on the battlepass while changing the icon to be Gold, purposely misleading everyone to think that they would get their battlepass in value, like many other games did. Then ppl called them out and changed it, tho at this point they already made their moneys worth by using malicious strategies.\n\n- The Devs dont listen or care about this game, constantly bad changes, adding stupid OP characters that 1 shot you across the map with perfect accuracy and hitscan on frame 1 while others have shit damage, shit range, shit spread and its a projectile. Not to mention their mentality that every character has to be a DPS. Some tanks and healers can deal more damage than actual other DPS.\n\n- In competitive you are either forced into roles or if you play open roles, people have huge egos and often end up with no tanks, no healers. Forcing down roles our throat also destroyed off tanks or utility characters to not be viable cause well, then you are missing a DPS, if you want to play a more flank or supportive DPS.\n\n- Microtransaction hell, free battlepass gives only throw away items. Everything is too expensive, I bought Overwatch 1 back in the day, so for me I paid for a game that now is riddled with microtransactions and free 2 play crap.\n- The singleplayer or coop missions are a joke and have barely any substance and last for like 40 minutes.\n- The events just recycle the same content over and over instead of making new things.\n\nOn top of all that Blizzard is a sexist, racist and generally fucked up place, I am sorry for any person that has to work for this dogshit company, having this shitstain of a company on your resume will probably label you instantly as all the horrible stuff that happens internally. \n\n[b]Pros:[/b] Handling characters is smooth, the visuals are crisp and high quality and the characters are memorable.",

My achievements can confirm this.\n\nIf you've never played, don't. Especially not now. The game was bad before, but at least it was fair and reasonably priced. Now it's an aggressive scheme to suck more money out of this dying game by making you pay for the characters in a game heavily focused on counter-picking to win.\n\nIf you've played before, don't come back. It's exactly what you remember, but with a ridiculously overpriced monetization system.\n\nin short:\nOverwatch is hot garbage. The balance is horrible, the players are miserable, and Blizzard regularly finds new ways to obtain the title of \"worst company in the game industry\".",
