It's quite sad that even a PS4 runs this game better than it can on Steam. It may be day 1 but this is still quite sad and they had so much time to fix issues and bugs. Running this game on Desktop mode on the steam deck the mouse cursor is bugged and the keyboard sometimes doesn't work. I like the game but at this current state on Steam its quite bad and needs to be fixed.",

Less players per battle (5v5) and ofc horrendous monetization. Same maps, same heroes, same forever balancing and nerfing act that never stops. No pve so really no reason to play much if at all.\n\nNow shower me with clown awards for the upvote.",

Все эти годы, начиная примерно с 2019-2020 года они никак не развивали первую часть, оправдывая это тем, что у них в разработке находится OW 2 с коопом, теперь у нас ни коопа, ни адекватного нового контента во \"второй\" части. \n\nЧто мы имеем в итоге? Разрабы выкатили первый OW с минимумом изменений, изменив некоторых персонажей, сделав 5 на 5 вместо 6 на 6, добавив скинов и, естественно цифру 2 в названии. Изначально это было объяснено тем, что готовится ПВЕ и его надо немного подождать, но потом вышла новость, что и его не будет. То есть, разрабы добавили цифру 2 в названии чтобы легально продавать скинчики на героев за реальное бабло...\n\nТрудно рекомендовать игру от разработчика, который так относится к своим же игрокам...",

Heroes, meta, community, ranked - all that was made to boil your blood. And Overwatch \"2\" is just a pure cashgrab for newcomers and those, who are too blind to see through it. How can you make a SEQUEL, that is just basically the same game with less features and more options to waste your money. I've never seen so much pop-ups and menus, that lead you to buy something. \n\nBack in a day this game was a prime example of multiplayer done right, now it's a showcase of what greed does to a good product.\n\nAnd as an OG fanboy i can say for sure, the decline started with Brigitte, and heroes that followed her. Heroes, who don't require you even to aim, or think, just mash buttons and receive +elo. \n\nAnd while i can still hop on for a quick game or two on Lucio once a year, this game is basically dead. Maybe not in player base (yet), but morally for sure. \n\nRIP Overwatch, you were a good game.",

And you're even proud of that? Toxicity at its best.\n\nTell you what, you don't hate Overwatch, you hate Blizzard.\nNay, not even Blizzard, you hate Activision.\nCan't you see how far you are from what you really dislike?\n\nHaven't really seen but a few reviews that had legit reasons (Balance, bugs) to dislike this game.\nYou're too busy hating Blizzard/Activision to make a decent review instead.\n\n\nHopefully OW2 gets a higher rating and Blizzard releases more games on Steam, but if these fake reviews stay and people actually believe them, I have my doubts.\nThis is exactly why \"power to the players\" is such a wrong statement, when the players are so bad.\n\nSome contempt is understandable, but we as gamers have the rare chance to post reviews about videogames, and we should try to be objective about it.\n\nAnd, for those implying that Blizzard is desperate for new players, while more players are surely a good addition for any company, also remember that Microsoft bought Blizzard/Activision effectively as of recent, so the idea to come on Steam clearly enough comes from Microsoft, and not from anybody else.\n\nGosh, working at Blizzard must be like hell thanks to the angry shitty (and possibly overgrown) kids bombing their games like this. \nYou should be embarassed of yourselves.\n\nOne last piece of advice to whoever hasn't played this game: just give it a chance and make an opinion for yourself, as all these crazy reviews are only confusing for any newcomer.",

Es ist ein 5vs5 Shooter mit verschiedenen Helden, welche alle unterschiedliche Fähigkeiten besitzen.\nEs macht an sich Spaß, nur ab und zu ist das Matchmaking bescheiden (wie bei so vielen anderen Spielen, die nehmen sich da nicht aus).\nDas Ranking System kann ich nicht beurteilen da ich eine zweimonatige Pause hatte, nur zu der Zeit war es Brutal schwer aufzusteigen, denn selbst mit dauerhaften Wins (ohne Lose dazwischen) wurde man meist runtergestuft oder man blieb da wo man war, was einfach nur Unfair war (eventuell ist es jetzt besser).\nDas Arcade System ist ganz lustig (nur würde ich mir eine zweite Seite wüsnchen) und durch das rotieren kommt auch Abwechslung rein.\nIch bin vom Launcher des Herstellers gewechelt und habe mehr als 1000+ Spielstunden in Overwatch verbracht.\nWas kann ich sonst noch sagen?\nRein nicht Herstellerbezogen kann ich nur sagen, gebt dem Spiel eine Chance.\nEs macht Spaß und sorgt für gute Laune (außer man ist \"Ich muss gewinnen um Spaß zu haben\" bezogen)\n\nWenn ich den Hersteller mit reinbeziehe: Hört auf die Community zu verar*chen.\nUnd wegen einigen \"Microsoft macht es besser\" Leuten.. ich arbeite mit M$ in der Enterprise Umgebung und da ist sogar Bli$$ tausend mal besser, also wird es eher schlechter werden.",

        "review": "Now, where to begin on this absolute trainwreck of a game? I guess a good place to begin would be the current ridiculous over monetization. Where Activision/Blizzard told us a couple years ago that revolutionary sweeping changes were coming to Overwatch, in fact these changes were supposed to be so severe  that they \"couldn't do them without a sequel\".  The impression that was given to the player was that there would be faster content release and a whole PVE game mode with stories and ways to level up your characters for those modes. Only one of those promises were half fulfilled, content is slightly faster to come out. Anything of any significance though is behind either a wall of legitimate YEARS of play time or 20 to 30 dollars. A lot of these new skins are either recolors of old skins that were made in the time of the first release of Overwatch, where you had the loot box system. The loot box system was set up in a way where you would get a free one for leveling up by playing, and during events there would be different challenges you could do to get them. Not to mention the weekly arcade challenge where you could get 3 free lootboxes. You could get ANYTHING in the game other than Overwatch league skins at that time. I remember lootboxes being controversial and labeled as \"gambling\" by some organizations and were actually investigated by some governments. The thing is though that in Overwatch 1 those lootboxes, you never had anything guaranteed ofc and on some occasion you may buy 20 dollars worth of lootboxes and you would get every skin for an event, this was hardly ever necessary though. If you played Overwatch 1 for half the amount of time that Overwatch 2 expects out of you to level their battlepasses full of garbage, then you could get every skin from an event. The current expectation is that you spend the price of a full game for a handful of skins or pay 10 dollars for the battlepass and play for a thousand hours while you unlock mainly garbage while you see things in the shop that are on theme of the battlepass that SHOULD be in the battlepass selling for 20 to 30 dollars. Not to mention the predatory manipulative slimy business practice that should be Illegal, where companies have these things in their shop that are \"on sale\" from release and make it appear like you are getting a bargain. When the truth is the price that it is at is what they intended in the first place, they just are trying to condition people to accept higher and higher prices for garbage. You look at some of the prices that these things are supposed to before  the \"on sale\" status is added to them and it is 90 dollars for 3 overwatch skins. Hmm should I pay for several whole games on steam or should I pay for 3 low effort possible recolor overwatch skins?  I think that should be a fairly easy question to answer. Why is it that the lootbox system in overwatch and in video games in general were seen as so controversial and ridiculous, but the whole \"battlepass\" system and locking every bit of significant content behind walls of the prices for full games is not? You could bring up the argument that at least with the battlepass and monetization of characters and skins you at least get exactly what you pay for, but I played overwatch 1 during that time I got nearly every skin and ofc I got to play every character from their release. These skins were on the same level of quality as these new skins and honestly can be argued to be even better in some cases. I spent  little to no money on this game (except for 60 dollars on release). I can only imagine what it must be like for new players, where all of those old skins are behind the battlepass leveling or 10 to 20 dollars. I would not play the game in that situation. I don't know how they expect anyone to see it as a good game to get into. Enough on the monetization though, now to the quality of the game itself. One of the few significant changes made in this \"Sequel\" was the change from 6v6 to 5v5, where there used to be 2 tanks 2 dps and 2 supports there is now 1 tank 2 dps and 2 supports. Now because of the \"disadvantage\" that tanks were given by the removal of a tank, they decided to buff tanks to a ridiculous level where they are the deciding factor each game. Tanks a lot of the times feel immortal and hitscan dps like widowmaker also feel even more oppressive. Because they took a tank out of the game and barely thought about it. New characters that are being released for the game either feel way too strong (Kiriko, Rammatra) or way too weak (lifeweaver), not to mention they made a transition from 6v6 to 5v5 with only minor changes, wildly enough it is not balanced when the same amount of healing is going out that was meant to heal a 6 person team is healing a 5 person team. There is also the fact that there is no Overwatch league anymore, so there is no competitive scene for it. The competitive system has also been ruined, you play games until you win 5 and then after that you get to see what you new rank is. Where in Overwatch 1  you would see your SR go up or down by numbers, other than when you were playing your placement matches that you could get a big increase of SR if you did well in. It was a lot more transparent and satisfying to watch your SR climb. Now it's like you are constantly playing placement matches, but the reward for doing well in them is a lot of times only a tier rank up from silver 4 to 3. I was playing on an old account and I played my 5 placement matches for the season, the game said I was considered silver 4. I played my placement matches for the season and I won 2 games lost 1 then won 3 I did well each game and had the most damage and eliminations most of the time. After playing those games I placed silver 4, the rank I was told I was at in the beginning. I played 5 more games and won all 5 of them in a row and did similarly to the way I did in my placement games. I was then taken from silver 4 to 3. I won 90% of the 10 games I played and my reward was a single skill tier up. Imagine if you played 10 valorant games and won 9 out of ten of them, or any game that has a reasonable competitive system. I should have gone a whole skill division up not a tier. I am not going to sit there and play that garbage game for several days not even in the right skill ranking, because not only is it not challenging for me. It is also ruining the game play experience of the people I am playing with and against. This game is dying and I think we will see the day the servers are shut down, sooner than later if they don't make massive changes to not only their business practices, but the way that they balance the game. I am hopeful and excited for the day I get to read that Overwatch's servers are shutting down. So do I recommend this game? Absolutely not.",
